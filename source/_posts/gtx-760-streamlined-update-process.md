## GTX 760: Streamlined Update Process

 If you‚Äôre using**NVIDIA GTX 760 graphics card** , and wish to boot your PC performance, you can try to update the graphics card driver.  

 You can download and update the driver directly from NVIDIA‚Äôs official website. Just follow steps below:

 1) Launch your favorite search browser. (Here I‚Äôll take Google Chrome for example.)
  
 2) Type ‚Äúnvidia 760 drivers‚Äù in the search box and press **Enter**  . Verify the correct result from the top of the result list. Usually, the first result will be the right one. Click on it then you‚Äôll be directed to the product page.

 3) Go to the **Drivers** tab.

 4) Under Manual Driver Search section, select the right Series (**Geforce700 Series**), product name (**Geforce GTX 760**) and the operating system version according to the system running on your PC. After that, click**START SEARCH** .

 7) Once download completes, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
