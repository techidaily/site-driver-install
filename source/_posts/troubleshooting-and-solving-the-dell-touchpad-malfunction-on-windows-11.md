## Troubleshooting and Solving the Dell Touchpad Malfunction on Windows 11

After upgrading to Windows 10, if you find that touchpad of your Dell computer doesn’t work correctly, you can try updating the driver. Windows upgrade or update most probably would cause driver problems. Windows 10 may fail to load the touchpad successfully.  
  
You can check driver status in[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). If there is driver problem with the device, you will see a yellow mark next to the device.  
  
There are 2 ways you can use to update the touchpad driver for your Dell computer running Windows 10\.

[Way 2(Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-dell-touchpad-issue-in-windows-10/#Way2)   
  
  
 **How to download and install the driver from Dell**
