 If you’re having a driver issue in your Microsoft Surface Pro 4, don’t worry. You can solve the driver issue easily by downloading and updating the**Surface Pro 4 drivers** in your Windows system.

## Try these methods

2. [Download and install Surface Pro 4 drivers automatically (Recommended)](#Fix2)

### Method 1: Download and install Surface Pro 4 drivers manually

 Before getting started, you should know for sure the device model that needs to update the driver.

 When you download the drivers for your Surface Pro 4, ensure you download the drivers from the official manufacturer’s website, which is safe to your computer.

 1) Go to **[Microsoft download center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49498)** [.](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49498)

 2) Select the appropriate language, and click**Download** .

 This requires time and computer skills. If you don’t have time or patience, or sometimes if you can’t find the latest version of a specific device driver from the website, you can try [Method 2](#Fix2) .
