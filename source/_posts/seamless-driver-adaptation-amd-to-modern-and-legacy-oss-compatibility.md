## Seamless Driver Adaptation: AMD to Modern and Legacy OSs' Compatibility

 If you’re using an AMD graphics card but randomly run into display issues, you could reinstall the AMD drivers to fix it. In this post, we’ll walk you through the entire process to reinstall AMD drivers easily and quickly.

**2 steps to reinstall AMD drivers:**

1. **[Uninstall AMD drivers in Device Manager](#step1)**
2. **[Install new AMD drivers](#step2)**

 The screenshots below come from Windows 10, but the method also applies to Windows 7, 8 and 11.

## Step 1 – Uninstall AMD drivers in Device Manager

 First off, you need to remove the AMD drivers completely from your PC. To do this, simply take advantage of Device Manager, a Windows built-in tool for viewing and controlling hardware.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .

2. Double-click to expand the**Display adapters** category, then right-click your display card and select**Uninstall device** .

3. Tick the box for**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** and click**Uninstall** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png)
4. On Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7, the option says**Delete the driver software for this device** , but it works the same. Tick the box and click**Uninstall** .

When it’s done, AMD graphics card will disappear from the list.

## Step 2 – Install new AMD drivers

 After finishing the steps above, restart your computer and Windows will automatically detect the AMD graphics and install the appropriate drivers for you.

 However, Windows doesn’t always provide the latest device drivers ([see why](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ). In this case, you should try the other two ways to get the correct and up-to-date AMD drivers:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically](#option2)** .

### Option 1 – Manually download and install drivers from AMD

 AMD keeps updating its drivers to fix bugs or add features. If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
