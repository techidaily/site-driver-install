## Harmonize Your Sounds: Easy Guide to Focusrite Driver Update

 Focusrite 6i6 is quite a cool audio interface for typical studio work and home multi-track recording. It delivers a well-balanced sound on vocals and instruments straight into your computer. However, sometimes it can bump into connection or performance issues. To make your Scarlett 6i6 always work to its top level, it’s very important to update the driver.

## How to update your Focusrite Scarlett 6i6 driver?

When it comes to updating a driver, you always have 2 options :

* Option 1 –**[Automatically update](#o1)**  
 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
* Option 2 –**[Manually update](#o2)**  
 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### 1\. Automatically

 If you don’t have time or patience to play with drivers manually, you can update your Scarlett 6i6 driver automatically.

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
