Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using.

 The website design can be changed. In that case, the specific steps may be different from the steps mentioned in this post. Just follow the on-screen instructions. If you are not sure how to download the right drivers in this way, proceed to another way.
