### **Method 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturers**

 Updating driver via Device Manager can be easier, but Windows may fail to provide a new driver. In this case, you can search and download the latest audio driver from manufacturers.

 You can go to the PC manufacturer’s website or the audio card’s website to check for the latest audio driver for Windows 10\. If you are using a branded computer, it is recommended to go to the PC manufacturer’s website first, as they may customize the driver.

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model or the device model and the specific operating system that you are using (See [How to Quickly Get Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).
