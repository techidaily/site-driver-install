## Powerful Performance: Update WIN Drivers

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b4db24096c45.jpg)

 On January 17th, 2017, Intel released version 10.1.1.42 of their Chipset Device Software.

 It is a common misconception that people refer to Intel Software Installation Utility, or also known as Intel Chipset Device Software, as chipset driver or chipset drivers. Because technically speaking, Intel’s INF updates are not drivers, but they do help update important files which will tell Windows how to use Intel integrated hardware. So, there is no harm keep calling them Intel Chipset Drivers.

**Download Intel Chipset Device Software**

**Note** : If you are not having problems with your hardware, for example, your display image is not showing correctly, or that you are having trouble listening through your speakers, then the update is not necessary for you.

 But if you really want the update, just make sure you have made a backup of your system and go for it. Intel chipset driver rarely cause problems.

To download Intel Chipset Drivers, just go directly to Intel:
