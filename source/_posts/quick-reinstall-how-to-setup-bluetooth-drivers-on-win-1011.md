## Quick Reinstall: How To Setup Bluetooth Drivers on Win 10/11

 If your computer is having Bluetooth issues, such as device not connecting, sound popping and lagging, one quick and easy fix is to**reinstall the Bluetooth driver** .

 In this article, we’ll show you 2 ways to reinstall your Bluetooth driver easily & quickly.

## How to reinstall Bluetooth driver

1. **[Reinstall Bluetooth driver manually](#method1)**
2. **[Reinstall Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)](#method2)**
3. [**Still can’t fix the problem? Try this.**](#fix3)

## Method 1: Reinstall Bluetooth driver manually

 To reinstall your Bluetooth driver, one option is to do that manually with**Device Manager** . Device Manager is a Control Panel app that allows you to view and manage the hardware of your PC.

 So firstly, you need to uninstall your current Bluetooth driver. Here are the steps:

 The following screenshots are from Windows 10, and the method applies to**Windows 11, 8 or 7** .

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and the**R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

2. Double-click**Bluetooth** to expand the category. Then right-click your Bluetooth adapter and select**Uninstall device** . (If you don’t see a Bluetooth adapter, try using [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to scan for missing drivers.)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/device-manager-uninstall-bluetooth-driver.jpg)  
 To identify the Bluetooth adapter, one common method is to look for the name that**starts with a manufacturer** (e.g. Intel, Qualcomm or Realtek) and**ends with a “Bluetooth”** .

**Then you’ll need to install the Bluetooth driver.**

 If you’re on**Windows 10 or 11** , Windows will automatically install the missing Bluetooth driver after a reboot. (Note that you might need an**Internet connection** for this function.)

 If you’re on**Windows 8 or 7** , you can visit the manufacturer’s website of your**PC or motherboard** , then search for your model and download the latest installation wizard compatible with your operating system.

## Method 2: Reinstall Bluetooth driver automatically (Recommended)

 In most cases,**updating the driver** gives you the same effect as reinstallation. And a new driver usually comes with**bug fixes** and a**performance boost** . This could tackle your Bluetooth issue right away.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee.
