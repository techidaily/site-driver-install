 **Way 1: Update the Drivers Manually**
  
You can go to Lenovo’s official website to check for and download the latest Windows 10 drivers for your PC. Following steps are for your reference how to download the driver from Lenovo. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using.  
  
1\. Go to [Lenovo’s website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2F)  .  
  
2\. Click **Laptops** .

 3.**Select Series** to the one that your PC belongs to. For instance, if you are using Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e, select the 11e Series. You can identify the right series by checking the whole displayed name. For ThinkPad series, you will see ThinkPad at the end of the name.

 6\. Scroll down and pick a component that you wish to update driver for. And select the Operating System to Windows 10 64-bit or Windows 32-bit.

 Then the drivers will be listed. You may see several options. Identify the right driver to download. It is recommended to download the latest version.  
  
**Note** if Lenovo does not release Windows 10 driver for the device or hardware, you can try downloading and installing the driver for Windows 8 or Windows 7, which is always compatible with Windows 10.  
  
 The website design can be changed. In that case, the specific steps may be different from the steps mentioned in this post. Just follow the on-screen instructions. If you are not sure how to download the right drivers in this way, proceed to another way.  
  
 **Way 2: Update the Drivers via Device Manager**
  
Follow these steps to install new audio drivers via Device Manager.
  
1\. Press **Win+R** (**Windows logo** key and **R**  key) at the same time. A Run dialog box will appear. Then Device Manager will open.
