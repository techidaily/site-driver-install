## **Way 2: Install the Latest Driver from Device Manufacturer‚Äôs Website**

If you can tell your PC‚Äôs or the device‚Äôs specific model name, you can go to their manufacturer‚Äôs website to download the latest driver.  The drivers normally can be downloaded in the section**Support** on the website (The method to find it will vary depending on the brand).
  
 To find drivers quickly, go to your favourite search engine and enter ‚Äúbrand name +model name + drivers‚Äù . This will often provide a direct link. Go to the link and you can find the driver you need there.  
  
For instance, update Windows 7 latest driver for HP Deskjet 1050\.
  
1) Enter ‚Äú  HP Deskjet 1050 driver‚Äù in the search engine. Then click the provided link to go to the download page.

 6) After download completes, just double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to update the driver.

 Updating drivers using Device Manager is easy to follow but Windows only provides some basic drivers. With this method, it is probably that you would fail to update the driver. Updating drivers by downloading drivers manually online requires computer knowledge and would cost you much time, as it is not easy to find the right drivers from the manufacturer‚Äôs website. So it is recommended that you use the third method to update drivers. The method is to use a driver update tool to help you.
