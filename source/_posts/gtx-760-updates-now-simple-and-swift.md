## GTX 760: Updates Now Simple & Swift

 If you‚Äôre using**NVIDIA GTX 760 graphics card** , and wish to boot your PC performance, you can try to update the graphics card driver.  

 You can download and update the driver directly from NVIDIA‚Äôs official website. Just follow steps below:

 1) Launch your favorite search browser. (Here I‚Äôll take Google Chrome for example.)
  
 2) Type ‚Äúnvidia 760 drivers‚Äù in the search box and press **Enter**  . Verify the correct result from the top of the result list. Usually, the first result will be the right one. Click on it then you‚Äôll be directed to the product page.
