## Next-Gen Sound on Win7 Powered by Nvidia

 You can’t hear sound via HDMI If you have problem with NVIDIA high definition audio driver. It is not easy to download the NVIDIA high definition audio driver manually. Here you will learn how to download and update NVIDIA high definition audio drivers for Windows 7.

There are 3 ways you can use to update the driver:

[Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager](#Way1)
[Way 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturer](#Way2)
[Way 3: Update the Driver using Driver Easy](#Way3)

**Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager**

Follow these steps:

1\. Go to [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  .  

 2\. In Device Manager, locate NVIDIA High Definition Audio Device. Usually, you can find it under category**Sound, video and game controllers** . Right click on it and select **Update Driver Software…**

 If Windows fails to update the drivers, you can download the latest drivers from manufacturers.

**Way 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturers**

 You can download and install the driver from PC manufacturer or NVIDIA. If you are using a branded computer, it is recommended that you check for the latest NVIDIA high definition audio driver on PC manufacturer’s website first, as they may customize the driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system (See [How to Get Windows Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 Alternatively, you can download and install the driver from NVIDIA. High definition audio drivers are part of Graphics card driver package. So if you want to update NVIDIA audio drivers, just download the driver package for your Graphics card.

Refer below steps:

1\. Go to [NVIDIA download page](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  .  
  
 2\. Select the product information and system information depending on the Graphics card and system version that you are using . (Here take “GeForce GTX 760” and “Windows 10 64-bit” as example.) Then click on **SEARCH**  button.

 5\. After download completes, just double-click on the downloaded file (.exe file) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

The driver will be installed in **Express**  way by default. In this way, all components in the whole driver package will be installed. If you just need to install HD audio drivers and not the whole driver package, choose **Custom** Install and uncheck the other optional driver packages.
