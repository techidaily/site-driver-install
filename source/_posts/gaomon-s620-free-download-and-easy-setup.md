## Gaomon S620: Free Download & Easy Setup

![gaomon s620 drivers](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/gaomon-s620-tablet.jpg)

 If you have a Gaomon S620 graphics tablet but it’s not functioning well or doesn’t give you the best gaming performance with Osu, it’s time to update your Gaomon S620 drivers. Generally, there are two ways you can get an up-to-date tablet driver. Read on and try the method you prefer.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your tablet driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 If you want to do the driver update by yourself, simply go to the official Gaomon website and search for the correct driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows.

Here are the steps:

1. Go to [Gaomon’s website](https://www.gaomon.net/) .
2. Select**Products** \>**Pen Tablet.**  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/manual-update-1.jpg)
3. Scroll down to click**S620** .
4. Navigate to the**Driver download** section and click the**Download** button next to the latest Gaomon Windows Driver.

## Option 2 – Automatically update the Gaomon S620 drivers
