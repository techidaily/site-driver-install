 If you have no time, no patience or no enough tech skill to find and download the driver by yourself, choose Way 2 to let Driver Easy help you then.

## Way 2\. Update Logitech headset drivers automatically

**[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  is a safe and really helpful driver tool. It  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 With its help, you can say goodbye to driver headaches and delays forever. You can update your drivers automatically with either the **FREE**  or the **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a **30-day money back** guarantee):
