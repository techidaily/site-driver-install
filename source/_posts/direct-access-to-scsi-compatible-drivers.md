### What is SCSI?

 Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a set of universal interface standards. It can physically link and transmit data between computers and peripheral devices such as printers, hard disks, scanners, etc.

 SCSI driver is like a translator to communicate with the SCSI adapter installed inside the computer to make the product work properly. This high-speed data transmission technology is widely used on small computers.

### How to update SCSI drivers?

There are two ways you can update your SCSI drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#op1) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically**](#op2) (Recommended) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 1) Find the model name of your product. You can check the product’s outer packaging to find its model name.

 2) According to the model name, go to the product’s manufacturer official website. Find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 3) Double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update SCSI drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the SCSI driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
