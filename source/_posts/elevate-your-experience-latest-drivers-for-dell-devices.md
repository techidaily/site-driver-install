 It’s essential to**keep ALL the drivers for your Dell laptop up-to-date** so that it can run in tip-top condition and nip all sorts of problems such as blue screen of death, sound not working issues in the bud.

 In this post, we’re going to show you 2 safe and easy ways to**get the latest Dell laptop drivers** .

## To update Dell laptop drivers

 There are two ways you can update your**Dell** laptop drivers in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** or**7** :

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#O1) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#O2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Update Dell laptop drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to**[Option 2](#O2)** .

 Rest assured that the link below is the official website and 100% safe. So to manually update our Dell drivers:

 First head to **[Dell’s official website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us)** [](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us) and check out the section for driver downloads. Then enter your model of Dell laptop and search for the specific drivers you’re to update. Be sure to choose **ONLY** drivers corresponding with your flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually (which could either be an**.inf** file or a**.zip** file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

 **Option 2 – Update Dell laptop drivers automatically (Recommended)**

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
