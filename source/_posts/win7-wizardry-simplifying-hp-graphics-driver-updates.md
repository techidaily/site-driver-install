## Win7 Wizardry: Simplifying HP Graphics Driver Updates

 If you’re having HP graphics driver issues in Windows 7, don’t worry. You can solve the issue by easily downloading and installing the correct **HP graphics driver** in your Windows 7.

 There are two ways for you to download and install the correct HP Graphics driver for Windows 7\. You don’t have to try them all; just work your way download until you’ve installed the driver successfully.

 If Method 1 doesn’t work for you, try [Method 2](#method2) to download and update the HP Graphics driver automatically.
