 3) Double click the device name that you wish to update the driver for. This is to expand the list of the this device.

 For instance, if you wish to update “Realtek High Definition Audio” driver, double-click “Sound, video and game controller” branch then you’ll see the “High Definition Audio Device” under this branch. Then right-click the device name and select **Update Driver Software…**

 In [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , you can click on the driver and get the name of current driver. Then locate the device in Device Manager using this name.
