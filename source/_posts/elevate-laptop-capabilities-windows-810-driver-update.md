## To update Dell laptop drivers

 There are two ways you can update your**Dell** laptop drivers in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** or**7** :

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#O1) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#O2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 **Option 1 – Update Dell laptop drivers manually**

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to**[Option 2](#O2)** .

 Rest assured that the link below is the official website and 100% safe. So to manually update our Dell drivers:

 First head to **[Dell’s official website](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us)** [](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us) and check out the section for driver downloads. Then enter your model of Dell laptop and search for the specific drivers you’re to update. Be sure to choose **ONLY** drivers corresponding with your flavor of Windows version and then download & install it manually (which could either be an**.inf** file or a**.zip** file).

Finally, restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
