## Elite Sound Driver: AMD & Windows

 The AMD high definition audio device is for sending sound over HDMI and Display Port connections. Graphics cards that are in the AMD Radeon™ HD, Radeon R9, Radeon R7, Radeon R5 family have built-in support for AMD High Definition Audio. If you have any issues with the driver, check the methods below for quick driver updates.  
  
**Method 1:** Download t he AMD Catalyst™ software suite from [www.amd.com/drivers](http://www.amd.com/drivers)  , which is packaged with the driver for the AMD High Definition Audio Device.

**Method 2:** Update through_Device Manager_ .
