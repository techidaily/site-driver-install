## **Way 2: Manually Update Conexant Audio Driver**

Conexant does not provide C onexant HD Audio Drivers for Windows 10  on their website. So you need to go to the PC manufacturer’s website to download the Conexant audio driver. To download the correct driver, you need to know the PC model and the version of Windows.
