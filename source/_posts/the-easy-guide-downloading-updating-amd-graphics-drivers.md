### Method 1: Download your AMD video driver manually

 As one of the biggest manufacturers of graphics cards, you can download the latest version of your AMD graphics driver from the AMD website:

 1) Go to [AMD support and download center](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download) .

 If the website automatically detects your AMD video card, you can click**DOWNLOAD NOW** to download the driver.
