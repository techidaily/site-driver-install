This will remove the adapter from the list and uninstall the driver.

## Step 2: Install a new network adapter driver

 To get a new network adapter driver installed on your computer, you just need to restart your computer and upon startup, the system will automatically reinstall the missing driver for your system.

 However, it may not give you the latest driver. So you still might face networking problems. In this case, you need to [update your driver](#step3) .

## Step 3: Update your network adapter driver

 There are mainly two ways to update your network adapter driver:[manually](#option1) and [automatically](#option2) .

### Option 1: Manually update your drivers

 Since Atheros doesn’t produce drivers themselves, you can go to your PC manufacturer’s website to check for and download the latest driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit). Usually, the downloaded driver will be in executable format (.exe). You can install the driver by just double-clicking on the executable file and follow the on-screen instructions.

 If your PC can’t be connected to the internet, download the driver using another PC with internet access. Then use a USB flash drive to transfer the driver to your PC.

### Option 2: Automatically update your drivers recommended)

 If you’re not familiar with the computer hardware and you don’t have the time to manually update your network adapter driver, we recommend you use [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) as your great pick.
