## Enhance and Streamline Your Display on Windows 11: Reviving Drivers

 HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface), the default audio/video connection standard, can bump into issues sometimes. Many would wonder if they can update their HDMI driver on their Windows 10/11 PC to fix problems like HDMI no signal, no sound, or not working at all. Is there a driver for your HDMI port?

## About HDMI related drivers

 Actually, **you don’t need a driver for your HDMI port or HDMI cable** . The HDMI port will work normally when all the connected components are communicating properly.

 You may experience problems with your HDMI if the**graphics driver is outdated, corrupted, or incompatible** with your operating system. Therefore, you just need to make sure the graphics card driver is up to date.

## How to update HDMI related drivers

 There are two ways you can update your HDMI related drivers (the graphics driver) on Windows 10:

[**Option 1 — Manually —**](#option-1) You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended) —**](#option-2) This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Your graphics adapter manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to its website, find the exact graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Automatically update the graphics driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience, or computer skills to update the graphics driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

_Display modes on Windows 11_

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/project-mode.jpg)

_Display modes on Windows 10_

* **PC screen/Computer only** — Only using the first monitor.
* **Duplicate** — Displaying the same content on both monitors.
* **Extend** — Using both monitors to display an extended desktop.
* **Second screen/Projector only** — Only using the second monitor.

 2) Experiment with each mode, and you will be able to see images on the screen connected via HDMI when the display settings are correct.

### Step 2 – Restart and reconnect everything

1) Disconnect all your HDMI cables from your ports.

2) Shut down all your devices (your computer, monitor, and TV) completely and unplug their power cables (and battery if you are using a laptop).

3) Grab a cup of coffee and wait for 3 to 5 minutes.

4) Plug the power cables (and the battery) back in.

5) Connect the HDMI cables back to your devices.

6) Power on the devices.
