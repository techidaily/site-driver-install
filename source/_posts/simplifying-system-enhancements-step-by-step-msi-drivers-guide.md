## Simplifying System Enhancements: Step-by-Step MSI Drivers Guide

 Updated MSI motherboard drivers provides high gaming performance. So it is important to keep the drivers up-to-date. Here you’ll learn two ways to download and install the latest MSI motherboard drivers.

**[Way 1: Download the drivers manually](#way1)**
**[Way 2 (Recommended): Download and install drivers automatically](#way2)**

## Way 1: Download the drivers manually

 MSI keeps releasing new drivers for their motherboards. So you can go to their website to check for and download the latest drivers that you need for your motherboard. The driver always can be downloaded on the SUPPORT section.

 Go to [**MSI**](https://us.msi.com/support/) website and enter the product name for a quick search. Then follow the on-screen instructions to download the drivers that you need.

 It is recommended to check for the driver release often in order to get the latest drivers in time. If you don’t have time and patience, you can consider using**[Way 2](#way2)** .

## Way 2: Download and install drivers automatically

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. **But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee)** :

 3) Click the**Update** button next to a flagged**MSI** device to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click Update All to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
