## Download & Update Guide for AMD's RX Graphics Card

 If you have an AMD RX 5700 graphics card and encounter some annoying issues such as black screen or program crashing or freezing, you are not alone. In fact, this sort of problem can be easily fixed as long as you install the latest AMD 5700 drivers.

 Here are two quick & safe ways for you to update your AMD RX 5700 drivers:

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

 The screenshot below are from Windows 10, but the steps also apply to Windows 7, 8 and 11.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 AMD keeps updating its drivers to prevent graphics card issues and glitches. You need to spend some time searching for the correct driver and installing it on your own. Here are the steps:

1. Go to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .
2. Select**Graphics** \>**AMD Radeon 5700 Series** \>**AMD Radeon RX 5700 Series** \>**AMD Radeon RX 5700** . Then, click**Submit** .

3. Choose your operating system. (For my case, I click Windows 10 – 64-Bit Edition).

4. Click the**Download** button next to the driver you want.

5. Double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instruction to install the driver.

 If you feel the steps above are a little complicated, try the automatic method below.

## Option 2 – Automatically update the AMD 5700 drivers (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the AMD 5700 drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
