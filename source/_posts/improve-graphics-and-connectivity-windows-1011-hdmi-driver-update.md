## Improve Graphics & Connectivity - Windows 10/11 HDMI Driver Update

 HDMI (High Definition Multimedia Interface), the default audio/video connection standard, can bump into issues sometimes. Many would wonder if they can update their HDMI driver on their Windows 10/11 PC to fix problems like HDMI no signal, no sound, or not working at all. Is there a driver for your HDMI port?

## About HDMI related drivers

 Actually, **you don’t need a driver for your HDMI port or HDMI cable** . The HDMI port will work normally when all the connected components are communicating properly.

 You may experience problems with your HDMI if the**graphics driver is outdated, corrupted, or incompatible** with your operating system. Therefore, you just need to make sure the graphics card driver is up to date.

## How to update HDMI related drivers

 There are two ways you can update your HDMI related drivers (the graphics driver) on Windows 10:

[**Option 1 — Manually —**](#option-1) You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 — Automatically (Recommended) —**](#option-2) This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 Your graphics adapter manufacturer keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to its website, find the exact graphics driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 10 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
