## No Fuss, No Trouble: W7 Wi-Fi Extender

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bffbfe02ba91.jpg)

 Itâ€™s essential to**keep the wireless driver up-to-date** so as to keep your Internet up and running properly. In this article, weâ€™re going to show you 2 safe and easy options to**get the latest Wi-Fi driver for your Windows 7 PC** , even if you donâ€™t have Internet access at the moment!

## Choose the way you prefer

 You donâ€™t have to try both methods to get your WiFi driver updated; just browse through the list and take your pick:

1. [**Update your wireless driver manually**](#M1)
2. [**Update your wireless driver automatically (Recommended)**](#M2)

### Method 1: Update your wireless driver manually

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PCâ€™s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If youâ€™re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Method 2**](#M2) .

 **In case you canâ€™t access the Internet on the computer in question at the moment** : you might first have to download the driver on a computer with a workable network connection and then transfer the file to the computer in question to install.

1. On the keyboard of the target computer, press **the Windows logo key**  and   **R** at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and click **OK**  .

2. Locate and double-click on **Network adapters** to retrieve **the brand** and **model** of your Wi-Fi adapter. (**Intel(R) Wireless-AC 9560** in my case)

3. On the computer with Internet, go to the brand manufacturerâ€™s official website and check out the **Support** section for driver downloads.
4. Search the model of your wireless adapter, click the right download link for your Windows 7 OS. Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click **the first** result for the latest driver version.
5. Move the downloaded file to the computer without the Internet.
6. On the computer without Internet, run the downloaded file (mostly either an exe. file or .inf file) and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the install.
7. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

### Method 2: Update your wireless driver automatically (Recommended)

 If you donâ€™t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver for your wireless adapter  manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You donâ€™t need to know exactly what brand and model of network adapter your computer is using, you donâ€™t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you donâ€™t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 **In case you canâ€™t access the Internet on the computer in question at the moment** : you might have to connect your computer to a wired Internet network for a quick & smooth driver update.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either **[the FREE](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  or **[the Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:
