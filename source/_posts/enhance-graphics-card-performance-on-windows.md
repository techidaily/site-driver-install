## Enhance Graphics Card Performance on Windows

If your computer is experiencing any of the following:

* acting laggy/choppy
* video stuttering (low FPS)
* poor monitor resolution
* strange bluescreen

problems, you’re not alone.

 And chances are, it’s time to update your driver for your**AMD Radeon R9 200 Series**  graphics card in order to smooth these problems away.

## 2 options to update **AMD Radeon R9 200 Series driver**

 There’re 2 options for you to update your **AMD Radeon R9 200 Series**  driver in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** and**7** .

**[Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)](#O1)**  –  This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks.

**OR**

[**Option 2 – Manually**](#O2)  –  You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right the driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 2: Update **AMD Radeon R9 200 Series drivers** manually

 AMD keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to AMD’s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

 You might not have to find out exactly which flavor of the AMD Radeon R9 200 series graphics card you have, as any right download within the same series family will work.

1. Go to **[AMD Radeon 200 Series Drivers](https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-200-Series-Drivers.aspx)**  , find the download section for**your Windows variant** (in my case, Windows 10, 64-bit), then click on any link that says **AMD Radeon R9** .
