## Revitalize Silent Windows 11 with Driver Rebooting

 When you run into sound issues on Windows, such as no audio, crackling or popping sound, reinstalling the audio driver could be one of the most effective solutions. In this tutorial, we will show you how to**reinstall the sound driver on Windows step-by-step** . You can easily reinstall the audio driver even if you don’t have any computer skills.

 First, you need to uninstall the audio driver from Device Manager. After uninstalling the driver, you can simply restart your PC to allow Windows to reinstall the audio driver.

## 2 ways to reinstall your audio driver

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#method1)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### 1\. Reinstall audio driver manually

 You can follow the steps below to reinstall your audio driver manually. First you’ll need to uninstall the audio driver.

 The screenshots below are taken from Windows 10, and the method works for Windows 11, 8 & 7.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc i** n the Run box and click OK to open Device Manager.

4. **Right-click on the sound device** and click**Uninstall device** (in some cases, this could be just Uninstall). In the below example, the sound device is Realtek High Definition Audio.

 The option**Delete the driver software for this device** allows you to delete the driver package from the Driver Store (For more information you can visit [Driver Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store) in Microsoft. If you don’t see this option on the**Uninstall confirm dialog** box, the driver package may have been removed. In this case, just click**Uninstall** to uninstall the driver.
6. **Restart** your computer. Usually, Windows will install an audio driver automatically when your computer is connected to the internet. (It may not give you the latest drivers — so if you found the issue persists, you can take the following methods to automatically check for driver issues or updates.)
