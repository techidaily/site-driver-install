### Fix 2: Update the driver automatically – Fast & Quick

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can update the Logitech C270 driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
