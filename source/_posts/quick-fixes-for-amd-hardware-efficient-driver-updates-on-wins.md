## Quick Fixes for AMD Hardware - Efficient Driver Updates on Wins

 If you’re using an AMD graphics card but randomly run into display issues, you could reinstall the AMD drivers to fix it. In this post, we’ll walk you through the entire process to reinstall AMD drivers easily and quickly.

**2 steps to reinstall AMD drivers:**

1. **[Uninstall AMD drivers in Device Manager](#step1)**
2. **[Install new AMD drivers](#step2)**

 The screenshots below come from Windows 10, but the method also applies to Windows 7, 8 and 11.

## Step 1 – Uninstall AMD drivers in Device Manager

 First off, you need to remove the AMD drivers completely from your PC. To do this, simply take advantage of Device Manager, a Windows built-in tool for viewing and controlling hardware.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** key and the**R** key at the same time, then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit**Enter** .

2. Double-click to expand the**Display adapters** category, then right-click your display card and select**Uninstall device** .

3. Tick the box for**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** and click**Uninstall** .![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/image-24.png)
4. On Windows 10, 8.1, 8 and 7, the option says**Delete the driver software for this device** , but it works the same. Tick the box and click**Uninstall** .

When it’s done, AMD graphics card will disappear from the list.

## Step 2 – Install new AMD drivers

 After finishing the steps above, restart your computer and Windows will automatically detect the AMD graphics and install the appropriate drivers for you.

 However, Windows doesn’t always provide the latest device drivers ([see why](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ). In this case, you should try the other two ways to get the correct and up-to-date AMD drivers:**[manually](#option1)** or**[automatically](#option2)** .

### Option 1 – Manually download and install drivers from AMD

 AMD keeps updating its drivers to fix bugs or add features. If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can go straight to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  , find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

### Option 2 – Install the AMD drivers automatically (recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to install the AMD driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and**install** Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  

 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with **full support**  and a **30-day money-back**  guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you’re not ready to buy the Pro version, Driver Easy offers a 7-day free trial which includes access to all the Pro features such as high-speed download and one-click install. You won’t be charged anything until your 7-day trial has ended.)

4. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.
