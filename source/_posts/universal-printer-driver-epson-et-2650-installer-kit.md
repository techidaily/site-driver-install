 If you have an Epson ET-2650 printer but it occasionally acts up such as printing blank pages, responding too slowly or giving unknown error messages, there may be something wrong with the driver. To keep your printer running in tip-top condition, you should update its driver regularly. And here are two easy and safe options:

1. **[Manual driver update](#option1)**
2. **[Automatic driver update (recommended)](#option2)**

## Option 1 – Manually download and install the Epson ET-2650 driver

 Printer manufacturers release new drivers from time to time to fix bugs or add additional features. You can manually check for the new driver and install it via the following steps:

1. Go to the **[official support website](https://epson.com/Support/sl/s)**  of Epson.
2. Type**Epson ET-2650** in the search field, and click**Epson ET-2650** from the search results.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 If this process is a bit complex and time-consuming for you, below is an easier option.
