## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

AMD keeps updating drivers.

 Most of the time, you can download the driver from [**AMD official website**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and get your GPU updated. Just make sure you locate the correct driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit). Download it and follow the on-screen instruction to complete the installation.

 But you may find**it doesn’t provide Radeon Vega 3 graphics driver** now.
