## Enhance PC Performance with AMD RX 570 Windows Update

 If you got an AMD RX 570 graphics card and hope it to draw the smooth, high-end graphics performance all the time, it’s necessary to get a correct and up-to-date driver for it. In this tutorial, you’ll learn 2 quick & easy ways to download and install AMD RX 570 drivers on Windows 11, 10, and 7.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the AMD RX 570 drivers manually

 AMD keeps releasing new drivers for its graphics cards. If you feel like updating the AMD RX 570 drivers by yourself, please carefully follow the steps below:

1. Go to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .
2. Click**Graphics** \>**Raden 500 Series** \>**Raden RX 500 Series** \>**Raden RX 570** .

4. Click the**Download** button next to the driver you want.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 The manual driver update process is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. If you prefer a simpler method, check out the second option below.
