![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5af0328223eef-269x300.jpg)

If your Lexmark printer isn’t working properly, or if you want to keep it in good condition, you should update its driver as soon as possible.

### There are two ways to update your Lexmark printer driver

[**Option 1** **– Manually:**](#man) You can download and install the update for your driver yourself. This requires some time, patience, and sometimes even computer skills

OR

[**Option 2** **– Automatically (Recommended):**](#auto) This is the quicker and easier option. This requires just a couple of mouse clicks!

## Option 1: Download and install your driver manually

To get the correct driver for your Lexmark printer, you should go to the **[Lexmark official website](https://www.lexmark.com/)**  and search for your printer driver download page, where Lexmark releases drivers and software for this printer. You need to download the correct and latest driver.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

When the download process has completed, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.
