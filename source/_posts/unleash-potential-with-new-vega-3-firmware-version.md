There are 2 ways to update the AMD Radeon Vega 3 graphics driver.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option-1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way. Because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#option-2) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

AMD keeps updating drivers.

 Most of the time, you can download the driver from [**AMD official website**](https://www.amd.com/en/support) and get your GPU updated. Just make sure you locate the correct driver corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit). Download it and follow the on-screen instruction to complete the installation.

 But you may find**it doesn’t provide Radeon Vega 3 graphics driver** now.

 Though you can find the driver file from other unauthorized websites, it’s time-consuming and risky. Wrong drivers may get your computer not working.

 To update the Radeon Vega 3 graphics driver, you can give a shot to **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  , a well-rated application with various certified drivers.

## Option 2 – Automatically update Radeon Vega 3 graphics drivers
