## Download Latest GeForce GTX 1650

 If you got an NVIDIA GTX 1650 card and hope it to draw the most smooth and stable graphics performance, you should always keep your graphics driver up-to-date. In this post, we’ll show you two simple and safe ways to update the GTX 1650 driver on Windows 11, 10, and 7.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option1)** – This requires some computer skills and patience, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, then download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 NVIDIA releases new graphics drivers on a regular basis and you need to head for its official website to check for updates. Here are the steps:

1. Go to the [**NVIDIA driver download page**](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx) .
2. Choose**GeForce GTX 1650** from the product list and select your operating system. Then click**Search** .  
 To download the optimized driver for the latest games, choose**Game Ready Drivers** for Download Type, or you can select**Studio Drivers** for design purposes.

3. Make sure your operating system is correctly detected. Then click the**Download** button.

4. After the download finishes, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instruction to install the driver for your Windows.

 The manual driver update is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. So if you prefer a stress-free process, check out the second option below.

## Option 2 – Automatically update your GTX 1650 driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
