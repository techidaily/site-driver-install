## The Ultimate Guide to 3Dconnexion Driver Setup

 Did you trouble by your unworking 3Dconnexion mouse? Have you checked its battery, your computer’s USB port but find nothing wrong? Well, don’t worry. If it’s not a hardware issue, you may need to download and install its latest driver.

## Why you need 3Dconnexion driver?

 Drivers are software components that make devices and the operating system talk to each other. Both system and device are updating to catch up with the changing world, so is drivers. If the operating system changes the way it speaks to devices and drivers haven’t updated, devices can’t receive correct commands and cause problems.

 That’s why most of the problems can be solved by installing/updating drivers.

## How to download a 3Dconnexion driver?

There are two ways you can update your network adapters drivers.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#op1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### **Option 1 –** **Download and install the driver manually**

**1)** Go to the **[3Dconnexion website](https://www.3dconnexion.com/service/drivers.html)**  and look for the product you have.

**2)** Download the driver according to your operating system.

**3)** Follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

**4)** Open your device and pair the computer.
