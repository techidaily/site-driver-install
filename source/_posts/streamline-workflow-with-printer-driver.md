![hp officejet pro 7740](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/printer-svgrepo-com.jpg)

 Looking all the way for how to download the latest driver for you HP Officejet Pro 7740? This article will provides you with two popular methods to download & install a driver for your HP printer in detail.

## Try these methods

 There are two ways you can get the latest correct driver; just pick the one you prefer:

* Option 1 –**[Manually](#m1)**
* Option 2 –**[Automatically (Recommended)](#m2)**

### Method #1 Manually

 HP keeps releasing drivers to add new features or improve printer performance to make your computer and printer work more closely together. Therefore, your printer may bump into various issues if its driver is improperly installed or outdated.

 It’s essential that you have the latest correct driver for your printer at all times. Here is how to update it manually:

 1) Go to **[HP Driver Downloads for Printers](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/printers)**  .

 2) Type**HP Officejet Pro 7740** in the search box and submit.

![enter your product name](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/HP-Officejet-Pro-7740-2-1024x594.jpg)

 3) In the search list, select the Basic Drivers and click**Download** .

![click the download button next to your driver](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/basic-1-1024x711.jpg)

**Note:** Before downloading, ensure the detected operating system is correct.

 4) Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 5) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.

### Method #2 Automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the HP Officejet Pro 7740 driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.
