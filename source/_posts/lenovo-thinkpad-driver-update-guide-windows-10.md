 Then the drivers will be listed. You may see several options. Identify the right driver to download. It is recommended to download the latest version.  
  
**Note** if Lenovo does not release Windows 10 driver for the device or hardware, you can try downloading and installing the driver for Windows 8 or Windows 7, which is always compatible with Windows 10.  
  
 The website design can be changed. In that case, the specific steps may be different from the steps mentioned in this post. Just follow the on-screen instructions. If you are not sure how to download the right drivers in this way, proceed to another way.
