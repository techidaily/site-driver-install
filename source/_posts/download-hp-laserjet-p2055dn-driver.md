## Option 2 – Manually download & install HP LaserJet P2055dn Drivers

 You can also search for the most recent correct driver for your printer, and download and install it step by step. But it’s rather time-consuming and error-prone.

 1) Go to the [HP Software and Driver Downloads](https://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-p2055-printer-series/3662052/model/3662058) page.

 HP website will automatically detect your operating system. But sometimes it won’t or you want to download the driver for another PC with other OS and versions. If that’s the case, you need to follow steps 2 & 3 to change a different OS. If it detected the exact operating system you’re using or it’s the one you’re looking for, then you can jump to [](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VzaZSyiHWBqHtqA2CDKkKtr%5FE%5FzE9bit-gRNzeKX1IY/edit?disco=AAAAJ4bzqbw#bookmark=id.fzgx3tocd8nj) [step 4](#step4) .

 2) Click**Choose a different OS** .

4) Choose the printer driver you need.

5) Select the printer model from the list of search results and click**Download** to download the printer driver.

 Note: the screenshot shown below is for Windows 10 (64-bit), for other versions, the results are different.

 Note:**Software-Universal Print Driver (1)** is for print administrators to install, deploy, configure, and manage the HP Universal Print Driver. You might not need it if you don’t need those tools.

 6) Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver, double-click on the**.exe file** to run the driver setup and follow the on-screen instructions to install it.

## Tips

 The installation files under**Driver-Universal Print Driver for Managed Services (2)** and**Driver-Universal Print Driver (3)** are literally the same. The only difference is that you need to use a USB connection to download the driver**for USB-connected printers** .

 For Windows, HP also provides you with Universal Print Driver for Windows PCL6 and PostScript to choose from. So you might wonder which one suits you best.

 In order to install the correct driver, you need to know the slight differences between PCL6 and PostScript.
