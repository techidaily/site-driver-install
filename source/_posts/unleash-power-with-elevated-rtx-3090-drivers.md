In this post, you’ll learn two simple ways to install and update the RTX 3090 Ti driver. It could be as easy as a couple of mouse clicks.

 1.**[Manual driver update](#option1)** – The go-to option to keep your drivers up-to-date, but the process is a little complicated and time-consuming.

 2.**[Automatic driver update](#option2)** – The best choice for computer newbies or users who don’t want to spend time searching for verified and correct drivers.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually
