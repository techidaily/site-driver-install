 Focusrite 6i6 is quite a cool audio interface for typical studio work and home multi-track recording. It delivers a well-balanced sound on vocals and instruments straight into your computer. However, sometimes it can bump into connection or performance issues. To make your Scarlett 6i6 always work to its top level, it’s very important to update the driver.
