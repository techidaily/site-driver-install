 This post will basically show you how to update device drivers in three different ways by the example of**audio driver** . These methods apply to all the other device drivers that you want to update.
  
**Quick through:**
[**Method One: Update Manually via Device Manager**](#1)
**[Method Two: Update from Lenovo Website](#2)**
**[Method Three: Update Automatically (Recommended)](#3)**
  
 **Method One: Update Manually  via Device Manager**
  
 Updating via device manager is a go-to option for a lot of people since it is the easiest and most convenient way of updating a device driver. But there is always a downside: the latest version of device drivers might not be able to be detected by Microsoft, and worse of all, sometimes, Microsoft even provides you with incorrect device drivers which could do a lot of harm to your computer.
  
 1) Go to **[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .
  
 2) Expand the category where the device driver needs to be updated. We are using audio driver for an example, so we expand the category**Sound, video and game controllers** .
  
 If there is something wrong with your device driver, you might need to look for it under the category**Other devices**  and see if devices with yellow exclamation marks can be seen.

 You may need to wait for a while for Microsoft to help you locate the correct driver.
  
 As stated above, Microsoft might not always be able to help you locate the latest or the correct driver, so if you find this is not helpful enough, you might want to consider going the second method.
  
 **Method Two: Update from Lenovo Website**
  
 1) First, go to **[support website of Lenovo](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%3Ffooter-id%3Dsupport)**  .
  
 2) Select the**Drivers & Software** button on the top part of the page.
