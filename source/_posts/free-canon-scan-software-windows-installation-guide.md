## Method 1: Download Canon scanner driver manually

 You can manually download the driver for your Canon scanner from the Canon support center.

 Before getting started, you should know clearly your**scanner model** , and your computer**operating system** (whether you’re using Windows 11 or Windows 10, and running 64-bit or 32-bit).

1. Go to **[Canon Support](https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support?tab=drivers)**  .
2. Search for your scanner model from the search bar. (In my case I search for **CanoScan** LiDE 120.)
