## Fast and Simple Guide: Updating Your Intel Bluetooth Device Drivers

Is your Intel Bluetooth driver outdated or missing in your computer? If so, don’t worry, the driver can be updated quickly & easily. There are three ways you can use to update the driver. Just choose an easier way that works for you.   
  
[Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
[Way 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturers](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
[Way 3: Update the Driver Automatically](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
  
 **Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager**   
  
This should be an easier way to update the driver manually. Follow these steps:  
  
1\. Go to[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/).  
  
2\. In Device Manager, expand the categories and locate the bluetooth device (The device is often listed under category “**Bluetooth**“). Then right-click on it and select**Update Driver Software…**

**Note** if the driver is having problem, the device may be not recognized by Windows. In this case, check if there is Unknown Device listed under “Other devices”, which could be the bluetooth device.  
  
 3\. Select search automatically for updated driver software. Then Windows will search and install the new driver automatically.

 **Way 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturers**   
  
If you are using a branded computer, go to the PC manufacturer’s website to check for the latest Intel Bluetooth driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system (see[How to Quickly Get Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)).
