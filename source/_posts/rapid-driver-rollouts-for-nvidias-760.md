## Rapid Driver Rollouts for Nvidia's 760

 If you‚Äôre using**NVIDIA GTX 760 graphics card** , and wish to boot your PC performance, you can try to update the graphics card driver.  

 You can download and update the driver directly from NVIDIA‚Äôs official website. Just follow steps below:

 1) Launch your favorite search browser. (Here I‚Äôll take Google Chrome for example.)
  
 2) Type ‚Äúnvidia 760 drivers‚Äù in the search box and press **Enter**  . Verify the correct result from the top of the result list. Usually, the first result will be the right one. Click on it then you‚Äôll be directed to the product page.

 4) Under Manual Driver Search section, select the right Series (**Geforce700 Series**), product name (**Geforce GTX 760**) and the operating system version according to the system running on your PC. After that, click**START SEARCH** .

 7) Once download completes, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.  

 If you don‚Äôt have the time, patience or computer skills to update your drivers manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don‚Äôt need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don‚Äôt need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don‚Äôt need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 3) Click the **Update**   button next to a flagged GTX 760 driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All**   to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   ‚Äì you‚Äôll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
