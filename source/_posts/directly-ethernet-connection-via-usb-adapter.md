 To set up Insignis USB 2.0 to Ethernet adapter and make sure it transfers data fast, you need to download and update your Insignis USB 2.0 adapter driver.

 When you purchase Insignis products, there’s a driver CD inside. But if it’s not so convenient to update the driver with the CD, don’t worry.

 There are two other methods you can update your USB 2.0 to Ethernet Adapter driver:

[**Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#method1)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

[**Option 2 – Manually**](#method2)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
