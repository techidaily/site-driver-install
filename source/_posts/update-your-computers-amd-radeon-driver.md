### Option 2: Update **AMD Radeon R9 200 Series drivers** manually

 AMD keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to AMD’s official website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly will compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril.

 You might not have to find out exactly which flavor of the AMD Radeon R9 200 series graphics card you have, as any right download within the same series family will work.

1. Go to **[AMD Radeon 200 Series Drivers](https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Radeon-200-Series-Drivers.aspx)**  , find the download section for**your Windows variant** (in my case, Windows 10, 64-bit), then click on any link that says **AMD Radeon R9** .
