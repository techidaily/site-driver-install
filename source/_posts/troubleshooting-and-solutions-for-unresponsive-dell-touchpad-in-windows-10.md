## Troubleshooting and Solutions for Unresponsive Dell Touchpad in Windows 10

After upgrading to Windows 10, if you find that touchpad of your Dell computer doesn’t work correctly, you can try updating the driver. Windows upgrade or update most probably would cause driver problems. Windows 10 may fail to load the touchpad successfully.  
  
You can check driver status in[Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/). If there is driver problem with the device, you will see a yellow mark next to the device.  
  
There are 2 ways you can use to update the touchpad driver for your Dell computer running Windows 10\.   
  
[Way 1: Download and install the driver from Dell](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)   
[Way 2(Recommended): Update the driver using Driver Easy](https://www.drivereasy.com/knowledge/fix-dell-touchpad-issue-in-windows-10/#Way2)   
  
  
 **How to download and install the driver from Dell** 
  
Before you get started, ensure that you know the laptop model and the specific system that you are using (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit).   
  
1\. Open your favourite browser and type “PC model+driver download”. Let’s take Dell Vostro 3460 for example.

 Note Dell may not release Windows 10 drivers for your PC model. In this case, you can download and install Windows 7 driver or Windows 8 driver, which is always compatible with Windows 10\.   
  
 After download completes, you can install the driver by just double-clicking on the setup file (.exe file) and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
