 Got a Hawku driver for your tablet in order to play Osu but it’s not working as expected? Don’t worry. After reading this post, you’ll learn how to fix the issue, and install your Hawku drivers properly!

## Try these fixes

 Here are 2 simple methods for you to troubleshoot the Hawku tablet driver not working problem. You don’t need to try them all; just work your way down the list until you find the one that does the trick.

1. **[Reinstall the Hawku driver](#fix1)**
2. **[Use other tablet drivers](#fix2)**

 To use the Hawku drivers correctly, first make sure you’ve uninstalled all other tablet drivers.

### Fix 1 – Reinstall the Hawku driver

 If your Hawku driver doesn’t work the way it should, there might be something wrong with your previous installation. And the easiest fix is to reinstall your driver.

There are mainly two ways you can reinstall the Hawku drivers:

**[1 – Automatically (recommended)](#option1)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

**[2 – Manually](#option2)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to reinstall/update your drivers this way, because you need to download the right driver online and install it step by step.

#### Option 1 – Automatically update the Hawku tablet driver

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to reinstall your Hawku tablet driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.

#### Option 2 – Reinstall the Hawku driver manually

 If you prefer to do the driver reinstall on your own, simply follow the steps below:

1. Open TabletDriverGUI.
2. Uncheck both**Auto Restart** and**Run at Windows startup** , and click**Save settings** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uninstall-hawku-driver-1.jpg)
3. Run**remove\_vmulti\_driver** . (Huion or Gaomon users should go to the**driver\_huion folder** and launch**Remove\_Huion\_64** .)  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/uninstall-hawku-driver-2.jpg)
4. Once completed, delete the folder.
5. Download [Hawku drivers](https://github.com/hawku/TabletDriver/releases/download/v0.2.3/TabletDriverV0.2.3.zip) and extract the file.
6. Open the folder and run the**install\_vmulti\_driver** file. If you’re using a Huion or Gaomon tablet, go to the**driver\_huion folder** and run**Install\_Huion\_64** .
