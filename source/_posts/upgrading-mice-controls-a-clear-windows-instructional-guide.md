### Method 1: Update Microsoft mouse driver manually

 The whole manual mouse driver updating process needs time, patience and certain levels of computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, **[jump to Method 2](#M2)**  to do it automatically.

**Device Manager** is an applet in Control Panel that allows us to view and control the hardwares in our computer. It’s also a good way to update the drivers for our hardwares. To do so:

 1) On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  and **R**  at the same time, then copy & paste **devmgmt.msc** into the box and click **OK** .

 2) Double-click on**Mice and other pointing devices** , right-click on**the mouse device** your computer is using and click**Update driver** . (Here**HID-compliant mouse** is used as the example mouse, same as below).

 3) Select**Search** **automatically for updated driver software** .

4) Wait a bit and see if Windows provides you with a driver available:

* If**yes** , then follow the on-screen instructions to update the driver and skip the rest of the steps. Then restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
* If**no** , and instead you got the message **The best drivers for your device already installed** , then you might have to continue with the following steps to get the latest driver for your mouse. Since the message isn’t always true and Windows can fail to do its job.

6) Search**the model** of your mouse, click the right download link for your Windows Operating System  . Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click   **the first**  result for the latest driver version.

7) Run the downloaded file (mostly either an exe. file or .inf file) and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the install.

8) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
