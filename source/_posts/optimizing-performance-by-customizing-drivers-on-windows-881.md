 In Driver Easy, you can click on the driver and get the name of current driver. Then locate the device in Device Manager using this name.

 4\. Click**Browse my Computer for driver software.**

 As you can see, it is not easy to update drivers manually even by following the detailed steps. And it takes time. It is recommended that you upgrade Driver Easy to [Pro Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . With Pro Version, all driver updates can be done automatically in one click. You don’t need to install the driver step by step. You can just leave the program running to update drivers and do something else.
