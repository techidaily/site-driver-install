## Instantly Improve Connectivity with Win11/10 MTK Support

 MediaTek chipset devices are all over the Android smartphone ecosystem. When it comes to data transfer between a computer and a MediaTek device, you’ll need to install the latest MediaTek drivers first.

 MediaTek drivers help to connect your device with your PC for better data transfer or stable connection. So if you get some error or failure notice when connecting, the most possible cause is outdated or improperly installed USB drivers.

 In this post, we’ll show you 2 easy ways to get the latest MediaTek drivers.

## Try these methods

There are two methods for you to download and install MediaTek drivers.

* Option 1 –**[Manually](#m1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.
* Option 2 –**[Automatically](#m2)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 Manually

To download and install MediaTek drivers manually, you need to:

1. **Download the driver zip file** .
2. **Advance restart your PC** and select**Disable Driver Signature Enforcement** .
3. **Install it on your computer manually.**

**Note:** If you don’t have time or patience to download and install the MTK driver, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can skip to **[Option 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do it automatically.

##### Step 1: Download the driver zip file

 1) Download the **[MTK Driver Zip File](http://www.mediafire.com/file/b1xjnx3mj7b7f8y/MTK%5FUSB%5FAll%5Fv1.0.8.zip/file)**  (All Versions).

 2) Extract the zip file on your computer.
