 If Windows fails to update the drivers, you can download the latest drivers from manufacturers.

**Way 2: Download and Install the Driver from Manufacturers**

 You can download and install the driver from PC manufacturer or NVIDIA. If you are using a branded computer, it is recommended that you check for the latest NVIDIA high definition audio driver on PC manufacturer’s website first, as they may customize the driver. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system (See [How to Get Windows Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 Alternatively, you can download and install the driver from NVIDIA. High definition audio drivers are part of Graphics card driver package. So if you want to update NVIDIA audio drivers, just download the driver package for your Graphics card.

Refer below steps:

1\. Go to [NVIDIA download page](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)  .  
  
 2\. Select the product information and system information depending on the Graphics card and system version that you are using . (Here take “GeForce GTX 760” and “Windows 10 64-bit” as example.) Then click on **SEARCH**  button.
