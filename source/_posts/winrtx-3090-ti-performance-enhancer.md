## WinRTX 3090 Ti Performance Enhancer

 Getting your hands on the NVIDIA premium graphics card RTX 3090 Ti? If you want to maximize the performance of your new gaming gears, you’ll also need to install the latest graphics driver. In this post, you’ll learn two simple ways to install and update the RTX 3090 Ti driver. It could be as easy as a couple of mouse clicks.

 1.**[Manual driver update](#option1)** – The go-to option to keep your drivers up-to-date, but the process is a little complicated and time-consuming.

 2.**[Automatic driver update](#option2)** – The best choice for computer newbies or users who don’t want to spend time searching for verified and correct drivers.

## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 The hardware manufacturer website is where you could always find the latest device drivers. To check for the 3090 Ti driver update from NVIDIA, follow the steps:

1. Navigate to the **[NVIDIA drivers page](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)**  .
2. Choose**GeForce RTX 3090 Ti** from the Product list and select your operating system.
