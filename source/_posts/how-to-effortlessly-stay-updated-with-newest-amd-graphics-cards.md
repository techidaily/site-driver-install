 Having an issue with your AMD video card? Don’t worry. You can update your**AMD video driver** to the latest version to fix any graphics issues, and bring you the best possible experience, especially when playing PC games.

 This post will show you three methods to download and update AMD graphics card driver quickly and easily.

## Download and Update AMD video driver for Windows 10/8/7

1. [Download your AMD video driver manually](#Fix1)
2. [Update your AMD video driver automatically](#Fix2)
3. [Update your AMD video driver in Device Manager](#Fix3)

### Method 1: Download your AMD video driver manually

 As one of the biggest manufacturers of graphics cards, you can download the latest version of your AMD graphics driver from the AMD website:

 1) Go to [AMD support and download center](https://support.amd.com/en-us/download) .

 2) You’ll see two entrances:**Automatically Detect and Install Your Driver** , and**Manually Select Your Driver** .

 If the website automatically detects your AMD video card, you can click**DOWNLOAD NOW** to download the driver.

 Or you can identify your AMD graphics hardware by selecting your video card model and Windows system to download.

3) Select the latest driver that is matched with your system to download.

4) After download the latest version for your AMD video card, install the driver in your computer.

5) Restart your computer.

 Manually downloading drivers requires time and computer skills. If this method doesn’t work for you, you can try other solutions.

### Method 2: Update your AMD video driver automatically

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can automatically update your AMD video drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to be troubled by the wrong driver you would be downloading, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version, it takes just 2 clicks (and you will get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee**).

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged graphics card device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version). Then install the driver in your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
