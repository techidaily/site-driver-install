 When your computer runs slowly, you may want to reinstall the NVIDIA graphics driver. In this article, we’ll show you how to reinstall the NVIDIA graphics driver in Windows 11, 10, 7 & 8.1.

 There are two steps you need to follow to reinstall the NVIDIA driver; just follow the instructions. Then you can reinstall the NVIDIA driver successfully.

* [**Step 1: Uninstall the NVIDIA driver**](#uninstall)
* [**Step 2: Install a new NVIDIA driver**](#install)

## Step 1: Uninstall the graphics driver

 You can uninstall the driver via Device Manager. Device Manager is a Control Panel application that allows you to manage devices and drivers in your system. You can uninstall, update, or roll back drivers via Device Manager.

 Follow these steps to uninstall the NVIDIA graphics driver via Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** keyat the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** to open the Device Manager window.

3. Double-click**Display adapters** , right-click your NVIDIA graphics card, then select**Uninstall device** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5bfb8fbb41a7c.jpg)
4. On the Uninstall confirm dialog box, select the**Delete the driver software for this device** check box, then click**Uninstall** .

5. On Windows 11, the message is different, but still, you just need to tick the box for**Attempt to remove the driver for this device** and click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://www.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/image-49.png)
6. Repeat the same to remove the driver for your other Nvidia display card if you have one.

 The option Delete the driver software for this device allows you to delete the driver package from the Driver Store (For more information about Driver Store, please see [**here**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store) .)

 If you don’t see this option on the Uninstall confirmation dialog box, the driver package probably has been removed. In this case, just click**Uninstall** to uninstall only the driver.

 After uninstalling the driver, move on to**[Step 2](#install)** to install a new NVIDIA driver.
