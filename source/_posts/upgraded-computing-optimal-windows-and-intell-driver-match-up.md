 It’s essential to**keep your Intel drivers up-to-date** so that your computer can run in tip-top shape and nip all sorts of common problems like computer flickering, freezing, sound not working issues in the bud.

 In this post, we’re going to show you**3 methods to get the latest Intel drivers** .

## 3 options to update Intel drivers

 There’re 3 ways for you to update your Intel drivers in**Windows 10** ,**8.1** and**7** . Just browse through the list and take your pick:

1. [**Update Intel drivers from Device Manager**](#O1)
2. [**Update Intel drivers from manually**](#O2)
3. [**Update Intel drivers automatically (Recommended)**](#O3)

### Option 1: Update Intel drivers from Device Manager

 Here**Intel® HD Graphics 4000** is used as an example of the Intel driver you’re to update.

 Updating drivers from**Device Manager** in our Windows can be a quick option. But one flaw in this method is that Windows can fail its job in keeping up with Intel’s drivers, hence returning you with no driver releases available messages.  You can jump into [**Option 2**](#O2) or [**Option 3**](#O3) to work around this problem.

So, to update our Intel drivers from Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  **![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)** and   **R** at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and press**Enter** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bbc8a5d2c212.png)
2. Right-click on**the Intel driver in need of an update** and click**Update driver** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/img_5bbc8a33e3a92.jpg)
3. Click**Search automatically for updated driver software** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1c4973b9174.jpg)
4. Your Windows will try its best to find the latest **Intel** driver available for your computer. Then wait a bit and see if you’re offered a driver update:  
   * If yes, follow the on-screen instructions, skip step 6 and restart your computer to finish the update process.  
   * If no, proceed with step**6)** .  

 6) You see the following result:  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1c49579eb1c.jpg)  
 It means Windows can’t find you an up-to-date **Intel**  driver and that you might have to check other methods to get it.

### Option 2: Update Intel drivers manually

 Here**Intel® HD Graphics 4000** is used as an example of the Intel driver you’re to update.

 In**Method 2** , we’re to download our Intel driver directly off the official website and install it on our own. And unless you know the exact Intel drivers in need of an update & the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Option 3**](#O3) .

So here we go:

1. Go to **[Intel download center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  .
2. Type**the model of your Intel product**  in the search box, and click  on **the model of your Intel product** once it pops up underneath. Then click on the **search icon** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5afcfdc0ec4e1.png) .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1c4dfe7fb4a.png)
3. Click on the result that matches for your Windows OS.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1c4e8d24b8a.jpg)  

 4) Choose the right   **.exe**  file  to download. Then double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to finish the update.  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c1c4f664a259.jpg)  
 5)**Restart** your computer for the changes to take effect.
