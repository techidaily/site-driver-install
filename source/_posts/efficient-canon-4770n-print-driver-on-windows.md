5. Restart your computer for the changes to take effect even if youâ€™re not asked to.
6. Skip this step if you can scan over a network/with a USB connection in your Windows system. But if you fail to do in either of them, you might need to go back to the download page to download & install a patch for it. Follow the prompts to so that the patch can solve the issue for you.
