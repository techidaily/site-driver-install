## Swift Drivers Update for Enhanced Logitech Audio

 Looking for the latest driver for your Logitech USB headset? In this article, you’ll learn every method to update your Logitech USB headset drivers, so you should be able to fix any sound issues on your own easily and quickly.

## About Logitech USB headset drivers

#### What is a headset driver?

 A headset driver converts electrical signals into sound, so it can really affect the quality of sound. Therefore, the driver is the most important unit in headsets, especially you’re using a high-end one.

#### So why using a Logitech USB headset?

 A USB headset is actually a combination of headphones and a microphone. Computer headsets connecting over USB connection offer high-quality sound without creating noise.

#### How to install Logitech USB headset drivers?

 Usually, you plug in, your computer will recognize the headset automatically and begin to install the Logitech USB headset drivers.

 But sometimes you need to install the drivers manually if the driver is outdated, corrupted, or incompatible with your operating system.

## How to update Logitech USB headset drivers

There are two ways you can update your Logitech USB headset drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#method1)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Method 1 – Use Device Manager

 Most USB headsets use drivers that are included in your operating system and do not need additional software to run. So to update the driver for your Logitech USB headset, you can do it in Device Manager.

1. Connect your Logitech headset to your computer.
2. Right-click the Start menu on the lower-left corner of your desktop.
