## Streamlined Software Upgrade: New Netgear A6200 Driver

 If you’re looking to update the driver for your **Netgear a6200**  WiFi adapter , you’ve come to the right place.

 In this article, we’ll provide 2 easy ways to help you get the latest **Netgear a6200** driver in no time!

## Try these methods

 Both methods below work in Windows 7, Vista and XP. You may not have to try both; just browse through the list and take your pick:

1. **[Update my Netgear a6200 driver manually](#M1)**
2. **[Update my Netgear a6200 driver automatically (Recommended)](#M2)**

### Method 1: Update my **Netgear a6200**   driver manually

 To update our **Netgear a6200** driver _manually_  , we might have to first go to Netgear’s official website, find out  the latest & correct version, then download the file and install it all on our own.

 Important: If you can’t access the Internet, you might first have to download the driver on a computer with workable Internet and then copy the file to the target computer to install.

 It needs time, patience, and certain levels of computer skills. If you’re not comfortable playing  with device drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to **[Method 2](#M2)** .

 1) Head to [**Netgear’s official website**](https://www.netgear.com/default.aspx)  and click the **Support** section.

 2) Type   **Netgear a6200 driver**  into the search box and press **Enter** .
