 After you upgrade the system to Windows 10, if NVIDIA Graphics Card drivers aren’t working, you can fix the problem by updating the drivers. There are two ways you can update your NVIDIA Graphics Card drivers.

[**Option 1: Update Nvidia drivers manually**](#manually) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 (Recommended): Update Nvidia drivers automatically**](#auto) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## **Option 1 – Update Nvidia drivers manually**

 NVIDIA keeps updating their drivers. To get the latest Windows 10 NVIDIA driver, you need to go to [NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) website, find the drivers according to your specific Windows version and graphics card model (see [How to Quickly Get Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) ).

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct driver for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

## **Option 2 – Update Nvidia drivers automatically**

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Nvidia driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2\. Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3\. Click the **Update** button next to the NVIDIA driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).

 Here take NVIDIA Geforce GTX 1080 for example. Driver Easy will detect the graphics card you’ve installed.
