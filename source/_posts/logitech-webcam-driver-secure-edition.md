## Option 1: Update your Logitech webcam driver manually

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your webcam driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

 You can first head to the **[Logitech Support page](https://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)**  and select the device model of your Logitech webcam. Then check out the section for driver downloads. **Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your Windows operating system** , and then download and install the driver manually.
