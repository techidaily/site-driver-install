## Streamlined AMD Audio Driver Release

 The AMD high definition audio device is for sending sound over HDMI and Display Port connections. Graphics cards that are in the AMD Radeon™ HD, Radeon R9, Radeon R7, Radeon R5 family have built-in support for AMD High Definition Audio. If you have any issues with the driver, check the methods below for quick driver updates.  
  
**Method 1:** Download t he AMD Catalyst™ software suite from [www.amd.com/drivers](http://www.amd.com/drivers)  , which is packaged with the driver for the AMD High Definition Audio Device.

Run the program and update the driver as instructed.

**Method 2:** Update through_Device Manager_ .

 1\. Go to Device Manager by pressing **Win+R**  together to open the “Run” dialog, and enter **devmgmt.msc** .

 Note that updating through Device Manager isn’t as efficient as we would usually expect. Often it may not be able to find the driver software, and the process can be time-consuming and somehow confusing.

 If you still don’t get the sound working after you update the driver successfully, then maybe you haven’t enabled the AMD HD sound device properly, refer to this [post](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) for a possible solution.
