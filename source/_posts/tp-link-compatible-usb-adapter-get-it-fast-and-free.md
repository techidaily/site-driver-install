## **Method 1: Install the TP Link driver manually**

 You can manually download and install the TP-Link driver by going to the TP Link website and downloading the correct drivers.

 Go to the **[TP Link official website](https://www.tp-link.com/us/support/download-center)**  to search the device driver that you need to install, and be sure to select for your**exact TP Link device** and**your variant of Windows** .

 For some products, you can directly install the drivers by downloading the **utility**  from the website. For example,**the TP Link TL-WN722N driver** , you can download the software from the website and it’ll automatically search the device and download the driver for you.

 But for some adapters with**.inf format** , you’ll need to manually install the driver in your computer, and also the device that the TP Link software fails to install drivers for. So you can follow the steps below to manually install the driver.
