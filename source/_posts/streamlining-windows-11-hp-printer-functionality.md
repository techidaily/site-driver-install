## Streamlining Windows 11 HP Printer Functionality

 After you upgrade the system to Windows 10, if your HP Deskjet printer doesn’t work as you expected or encounter problems, it most properly has driver issues. In this case, you need to fix the driver issues by updating the drivers.

 [20151215145824](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151215145824.png) ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151215145824.png)

  New system always has driver compatibility issues, especially for Windows 10\. For many manufacturers, they have not released Windows 10 drivers, as Windows 10 was released not long ago. So HP may not release Windows 10 drivers for your printer model.

  HP has declared that Most HP printers in use with Windows 7 or Windows 8 will continue to work smoothly without the need to reinstall drivers. If you upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8, your HP Deskjet printer should have worked with no problems. Or you may need to install the latest Windows 10 driver.

  Following are the common HP Deskjet printers which have Windows 10 drivers. If your printer is one of them, it supports Windows 10\. To quickly locate your printer model, hold down the**CTRL** and**F** keys. In the search box that displays, type the printer model number and press **Enter** to find your printer.

  If your printer doesn’t have Windows 10 driver, you can check if it has additional drivers, which may be right for Windows 10\. The additional drivers are **Basic driver** , **Universal Print Driver** , **PCL 6 driver** , **HP Enterprise driver** ,   **HP Host-based Plug and Play (PnP) driver** .

  There are three methods below you can use to update the drivers. They are two traditional methods and one more effective method.

 **Method 1:**

**Download the driver from HP**

  Go to [HP Customer Support – Software and Driver Downloads](http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers) . Then enter your HP model number to find your product. After that, you will be directed to the download page. You can find the right drivers there. If you can find Windows 10 driver, your printer definitely supports Windows 10\. (example: j110a).  Usually, you just need to double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If there is no Windows 10 driver, try the additional drivers.

  1\. Enter your HP Deskjet Printer model then click on **Find my product button.**

  2\. Select System version as Windows 10, the click on **Update**  button.

 **Method 2:**

**Use Windows Update to update the driver**

  Some printers have drivers installed through Microsoft Windows Update. So you can try updating the drivers through Windows Update.

 Following steps are for your reference how to use Windows Update in Windows 10 to update drivers.

  1\. Click **Start** menu and click **Settings** .

  3\. In **UPDATE & SE** **CURITY** , click **Windows Update**  in left pane.

 Click **Check for updates** , and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.

 4\. Click the link that tells you optional updates are available. (If you don’t see this link, it means Windows Update didn’t find any updates for your computer.)

 5\. Select the driver you want to install, click **OK** , and then click **Install updates** .

  You need to update drivers manually by using Method 1 and Method 2\. And it may take you a lot of time to find drivers and install the drivers. Following you will learn the most effective update method.

 **Method 3:**

 **Use [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update the drivers automatically**

  Download the driver from HP or use Windows Update requires some computer skills and could take you much time. But with Driver Easy, you just need to click several clicks to download and install the driver. Driver Easy will detect all problem drivers in your computer, then download the new drivers. So it will find the right driver for your HP Deskjet printer. If it doesn’t find the driver, most probably is because your printer model doesn’t support Windows 10\. You may need to replace a most current printer.

 Driver Easy has Free version and PRO version. Both versions can be used to download drivers automatically. The Free version allows you to update all drivers with limited download speed. But with the PRO version, you can update all drivers by just clicking the mouse two times and enjoy full features.
