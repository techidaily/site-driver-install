## Method 1: Reinstall Bluetooth driver manually

 To reinstall your Bluetooth driver, one option is to do that manually with**Device Manager** . Device Manager is a Control Panel app that allows you to view and manage the hardware of your PC.

 So firstly, you need to uninstall your current Bluetooth driver. Here are the steps:

 The following screenshots are from Windows 10, and the method applies to**Windows 11, 8 or 7** .

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and the**R** key at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type or paste**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** .

 To identify the Bluetooth adapter, one common method is to look for the name that**starts with a manufacturer** (e.g. Intel, Qualcomm or Realtek) and**ends with a “Bluetooth”** .
3. In the pop-up window, check the box next to**Delete the driver software for this device** . Then click**Uninstall** .

 If you’re on**Windows 10 or 11** , Windows will automatically install the missing Bluetooth driver after a reboot. (Note that you might need an**Internet connection** for this function.)

 If you’re on**Windows 8 or 7** , you can visit the manufacturer’s website of your**PC or motherboard** , then search for your model and download the latest installation wizard compatible with your operating system.
