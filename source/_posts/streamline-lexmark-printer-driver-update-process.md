## Option 1: Download and install your driver manually

To get the correct driver for your Lexmark printer, you should go to the **[Lexmark official website](https://www.lexmark.com/)**  and search for your printer driver download page, where Lexmark releases drivers and software for this printer. You need to download the correct and latest driver.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

When the download process has completed, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.
