## Mastering the Art of Mouse Driver Restoration

 If you’re encountering USB mouse detection and functionality issues, you may want to reinstall your mouse driver on your computer. In this article, we’ll show you how to reinstall your mouse driver easily and quickly.  
 (Screenshots below come from Windows 10\. Your screen might look slightly different if you’re using Windows 11\.)

**Steps to reinstall your mouse driver:**

1. **[Uninstall your mouse driver in Device Manager](#step1)**
2. **[Install a new mouse driver](#step2)**
3. **[If your mouse is still not working properly…](#step3)**

## Step 1 – Uninstall your mouse driver

 To uninstall your mouse driver, you can use Device Manager, which shows a list of all the hardware components that are inside your computer or connected to it.

1. On your keyboard, press the **Windows logo key** and **R**  at the same time to invoke the Run box. Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** to open Device Manager.

 After uninstalling your mouse driver, move on to [step 2](#step2) to install a new one.

## Step 2 – Install a new mouse driver

 To get a new mouse driver installed on your computer, you just need to restart your computer, and upon startup, the system will automatically reinstall the mouse driver to your system.

 However, this method may not give you the latest driver. If you have any input lag issues, we recommend using Driver Easy to help you detect any missing drivers, and download and install them automatically.
