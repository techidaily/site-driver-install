## Easy Install for GTX 760 Drivers

 If you’re using**NVIDIA GTX 760 graphics card** , and wish to boot your PC performance, you can try to update the graphics card driver.  

 You can download and update the driver directly from NVIDIA’s official website. Just follow steps below:

 1) Launch your favorite search browser. (Here I’ll take Google Chrome for example.)
  
 2) Type “nvidia 760 drivers” in the search box and press **Enter**  . Verify the correct result from the top of the result list. Usually, the first result will be the right one. Click on it then you’ll be directed to the product page.

 3) Go to the **Drivers** tab.
