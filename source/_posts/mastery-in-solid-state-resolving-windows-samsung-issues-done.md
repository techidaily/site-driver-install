###  Fix 1: Download Samsung SSD driver manually

 You can manually download the driver for your Samsung SSD from the Samsung website.

 However, only some of the SSD drivers are available to download in Samsung Support center, such as  Samsung NVMe SSD 970 PRO, 970 EVO, 960 PRO, 960 EVO and 950 PRO. Apart from those, you may need to try [Fix 2](#Fix2) to download the SSD driver from Windows, as Samsung only provides the firmware downloads.
