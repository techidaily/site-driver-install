### Method 1: Manually

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using (Windows 10 64-bit or Windows 10 32-bit).

1. Go to the [driver download page](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBBT400/HelpDesk%5FDownload/) for USB-BT400.
2. Select your operating system.
