Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using.

 3.**Select Series** to the one that your PC belongs to. For instance, if you are using Lenovo ThinkPad Yoga 11e, select the 11e Series. You can identify the right series by checking the whole displayed name. For ThinkPad series, you will see ThinkPad at the end of the name.

 The website design can be changed. In that case, the specific steps may be different from the steps mentioned in this post. Just follow the on-screen instructions. If you are not sure how to download the right drivers in this way, proceed to another way.
