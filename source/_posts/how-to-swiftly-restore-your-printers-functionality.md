 If you’re having printer problems,**reinstalling the printer driver on your PC** should be your go-to solution. This requires less computer skills and can save you lots of troubleshooting. In this tutorial, we’ll show you how to reinstall your printer driver easily & quickly.

## 2 ways to reinstall your printer driver

1. [Reinstall your printer driver manually](#method1)
2. **[Reinstall your printer driver automatically (Recommended)](#method2)**

### Method 1: Reinstall your printer driver manually

 To reinstall your printer driver manually, first you need to**uninstall your current printer driver** .

To do so, simply follow these steps:

 The screenshots below are taken from Windows 10, and the method works for Windows 11, 8 & 7.

1. On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the R key) at the same time to invoke the**Run box** .

 Then you need to go to**your printer manufacturer’s website** and search for your printer model. Be sure to download the latest correct driver installer that’s compatible with your system. If you’re not familiar with computer drivers, you can continue to the next method to**download and install drivers automatically** .

### Method 2: Reinstall your printer driver automatically (Recommended)

 In most cases,**updating your printer driver** has the same effect as reinstalling it. Manufacturers release new drivers on a regular basis, addressing security issues and improving printer performance. This is exactly why we recommend you to always keep your drivers up to date.

 You can use these steps to install the latest printer driver automatically:

1. [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.
