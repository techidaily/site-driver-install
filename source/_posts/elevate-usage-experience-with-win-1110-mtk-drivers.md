## Elevate Usage Experience with Win 11/10 MTK Drivers

 MediaTek chipset devices are all over the Android smartphone ecosystem. When it comes to data transfer between a computer and a MediaTek device, you’ll need to install the latest MediaTek drivers first.

 In this post, we’ll show you 2 easy ways to get the latest MediaTek drivers.

## Try these methods

There are two methods for you to download and install MediaTek drivers.

* Option 1 –**[Manually](#m1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.
* Option 2 –**[Automatically](#m2)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 Manually

To download and install MediaTek drivers manually, you need to:

1. **Download the driver zip file** .
2. **Advance restart your PC** and select**Disable Driver Signature Enforcement** .
3. **Install it on your computer manually.**

**Note:** If you don’t have time or patience to download and install the MTK driver, or you’re not confident playing around with drivers manually, you can skip to **[Option 2](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  to do it automatically.

##### Step 1: Download the driver zip file

 1) Download the **[MTK Driver Zip File](http://www.mediafire.com/file/b1xjnx3mj7b7f8y/MTK%5FUSB%5FAll%5Fv1.0.8.zip/file)**  (All Versions).

 2) Extract the zip file on your computer.

 3) Open the folder, and run the**MTK\_USB\_All\_v1.0.8** application.

 4) Follow the instructions in the wizard to save the driver folder.

##### Step 2: Disable Driver Signature Enforcement

**Note:** Windows enforces driver signatures by default. For non-digitally signed drivers, you need to disable Driver Signature Enforcement before installing.

**On Windows 10:**

 1) Click**Settings** and select**Update & Security** .
