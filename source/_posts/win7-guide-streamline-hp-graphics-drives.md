## Win7 Guide: Streamline HP Graphics Drives

 If you’re having HP graphics driver issues in Windows 7, don’t worry. You can solve the issue by easily downloading and installing the correct **HP graphics driver** in your Windows 7.

 If Method 1 doesn’t work for you, try [Method 2](#method2) to download and update the HP Graphics driver automatically.

### **Method 2: Update the driver automatically**
