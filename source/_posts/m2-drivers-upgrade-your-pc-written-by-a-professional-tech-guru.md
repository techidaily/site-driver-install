## M.2 Drivers: Upgrade Your PC' Written by a Professional Tech Guru

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/img_5c10a917aa187.png)

 If you’re using**M.2 SSD** (Solid-State Drive) on your computer, you’ll need a driver for your M.2 SSD to connect properly. This post will show you how to download and install the**M.2 driver** on your Windows computer.

## What is M.2 SSD?

 M.2 was formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor, and it’s standard for internally mounted computer cards and associated connectors.

 M.2 SSDs use the PCI Express 3.0 connector, SATA 3.0 connector, and USB 3.0 connector.  
 To ensure your M.2 drive works perfectly with your computer, you should install an M.2 driver for it.

## Try these fixes

1. [Download and install M.2 driver manually](#M1)
2. [Download and install M.2 driver automatically](#M2)

### Method 1: Download and install M.2 driver manually

 To manually install M.2 driver for your drive, you’ll need to download the correct driver from your manufacturer. Since the drive manufacturers vary from brand to brand, so we won’t cover it here.

 Usually, you can go to the manufacturer’s website, such as Samsung or ASUS, search for the latest correct driver, and download it into your computer. Be sure to download the driver that is compatible with your Windows OS.

 This method requires time and computer skills. If it doesn’t work for you, don’t worry. There’s something else to try.
