## Why you need the Xerox WorkCentre 6515 driver

 Drivers are important in computer operation. Because they serve as an interpreter between a computer’s system and its hardware. As for a printer, it could go wrong if:

* **Your printer driver is faulty or damaged.**
* **The printer driver is incompatible with the latest version of your operating system.**
* **Your printer driver is outdated and may contain bugs that affect the performance of your Xerox printer.**

 Therefore, having an up-to-date driver is needed for keeping your Xerox printer in good condition.

## How to update your Xerox WorkCentre 6515 driver

 Here are the two methods you can try to download or update the printer driver. You may not need to try both. Just pick one to try depending on whether you want to do it manually or automatically.

1. **[Automatically update the printer driver with Driver Easy (recommended)](#method-1)**
2. **[Manually download the printer driver from the official website](#method-2)**
