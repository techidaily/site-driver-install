## Try these methods

There are two methods for you to download and install MediaTek drivers.

* Option 1 –**[Manually](#m1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it, and install it step by step.
* Option 2 –**[Automatically](#m2)** – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks even if you’re a computer newbie.

### Option 1 Manually

To download and install MediaTek drivers manually, you need to:

1. **Download the driver zip file** .
2. **Advance restart your PC** and select**Disable Driver Signature Enforcement** .
