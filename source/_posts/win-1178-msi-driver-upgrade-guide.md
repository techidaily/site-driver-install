## Win 11/7/8: MSI Driver Upgrade Guide

 Updated MSI motherboard drivers provides high gaming performance. So it is important to keep the drivers up-to-date. Here you’ll learn two ways to download and install the latest MSI motherboard drivers.

**[Way 1: Download the drivers manually](#way1)**
**[Way 2 (Recommended): Download and install drivers automatically](#way2)**

## Way 1: Download the drivers manually

 MSI keeps releasing new drivers for their motherboards. So you can go to their website to check for and download the latest drivers that you need for your motherboard. The driver always can be downloaded on the SUPPORT section.

 Go to [**MSI**](https://us.msi.com/support/) website and enter the product name for a quick search. Then follow the on-screen instructions to download the drivers that you need.

 It is recommended to check for the driver release often in order to get the latest drivers in time. If you don’t have time and patience, you can consider using**[Way 2](#way2)** .

## Way 2: Download and install drivers automatically

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the MSI motherboard driver manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. **But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee)** :

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click**Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the**Update** button next to a flagged**MSI** device to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click Update All to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
