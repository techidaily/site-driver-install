## Unlock PC Potential - MTK USB for Windows OSes

 MediaTek chipset devices are all over the Android smartphone ecosystem. When it comes to data transfer between a computer and a MediaTek device, you’ll need to install the latest MediaTek drivers first.

 MediaTek drivers help to connect your device with your PC for better data transfer or stable connection. So if you get some error or failure notice when connecting, the most possible cause is outdated or improperly installed USB drivers.

 In this post, we’ll show you 2 easy ways to get the latest MediaTek drivers.

To download and install MediaTek drivers manually, you need to:

1. **Download the driver zip file** .

##### Step 1: Download the driver zip file

 1) Download the **[MTK Driver Zip File](http://www.mediafire.com/file/b1xjnx3mj7b7f8y/MTK%5FUSB%5FAll%5Fv1.0.8.zip/file)**  (All Versions).
