## Reverse FTDI Serial Connectivity Issues

 If your FTDI cannot be recognized by your computer, you can try to update the FTDI USB to serial driver to fix the issue.  

 There are**two** ways to update the FTDI USB to serial driver. You can either of the ways to update the driver.  

[**Way 1: Update the FTDI USB to serial driver manually**](#way1) [**Way 2: Update the FTDI USB to serial driver automatically**](#way2)

 You can download the latest FTDI driver from FTDI official website. Following steps are for your reference how to download and install the driver from FTDI manufacturer. Note the steps will be different if their website is redesigned.

## Way 1: Update the FTDI USB to serial driver manually

 2\. Locate the driver for Windows and click the**setup executable** to download the executable file.

**Note** : If you click on the version name, you’ll get driver with .inf file which requires you to install the driver step by step through [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . We don’t recommend you download this file unless you can’t use the executable file to install the driver successfully.  

 3.**Double-click the downloaded file** then**double-click on the Setup file** .
