### Option 1: Update Intel drivers from Device Manager

 Here**Intel® HD Graphics 4000** is used as an example of the Intel driver you’re to update.

 Updating drivers from**Device Manager** in our Windows can be a quick option. But one flaw in this method is that Windows can fail its job in keeping up with Intel’s drivers, hence returning you with no driver releases available messages.  You can jump into [**Option 2**](#O2) or [**Option 3**](#O3) to work around this problem.

So, to update our Intel drivers from Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press **the Windows logo key**  **![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ae0331bc08e4.png)** and   **R** at the same time, then type **devmgmt.msc**  into the box and press**Enter** .

### Option 2: Update Intel drivers manually

 Here**Intel® HD Graphics 4000** is used as an example of the Intel driver you’re to update.

 In**Method 2** , we’re to download our Intel driver directly off the official website and install it on our own. And unless you know the exact Intel drivers in need of an update & the variant of your Windows Operating System, it can present certain levels of difficulty.

**Warning** : Downloading the wrong driver or installing it incorrectly can compromise your PC’s stability and even cause the whole system to crash. So please proceed at your own peril. If you’re not comfortable playing around with drivers, or worrying about any risks in the process, jump to [**Option 3**](#O3) .

So here we go:

1. Go to **[Intel download center](https://downloadcenter.intel.com/)**  .
2. Type**the model of your Intel product**  in the search box, and click  on **the model of your Intel product** once it pops up underneath. Then click on the **search icon** ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5afcfdc0ec4e1.png) .
