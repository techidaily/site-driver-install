 The screenshots below are from Windows 10, and the method also applies to Windows 11, 8 or 7.

3. Restart your computer.

 Now you can choose to**purge the leftover files** as well. Or jump to [install the latest Wacom drivers](#step2) .

#### Purge the leftover files

1. On your keyboard, press the**Win+R** (the Windows logo key and the r key) to open the Run box. Type or paste**control.exe folders** and click**OK** .

3. Delete these folders:  
   * C:\\Program Files\\Tablet  
   * C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\WTablet  
   * C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\wactemp  
   * C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Wacom
4. Go to**C:\\Windows\\System32\\** and delete the following files:  
   * WacDriverDLCoinst.dll  
   * Wacom\_Tablet.dll  
   * Wacom\_Touch\_Tablet.dll  
   * WacomMT.dll  
   * WacomTabletUserDefaults.xml  
   * WacomTouchUserDefaults.xml  
   * Wacom\_Tablet.dat

 Now there should be no remaining Wacom files on your PC. But be advised that the Wacom tablet requires the latest correct drivers to work properly. So after uninstalling the old drivers, the first thing you need to do is**reinstall the latest drivers** .

### Step 2: Reinstall the latest Wacom drivers

 There’re 2 ways you can reinstall the latest Wacom drivers: manually or automatically (recommended).

#### Option 1: Reinstall the Wacom drivers manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to reinstall the Wacom drivers manually.

 To do so, visit the Wacom support page and search for your device model. Then download the correct drivers that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Reinstall the Wacom drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to reinstall the Wacom drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
