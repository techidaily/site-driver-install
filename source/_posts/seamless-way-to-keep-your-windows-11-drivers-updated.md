## Seamless Way to Keep Your Windows 11 Drivers Updated

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Windows11.jpg)

 Windows changes significantly over the next few years with the release of Windows 11\. But it remains all the same when it comes to driver updates.

 Just like Windows 10, Windows 11 automatically update drivers through OS updates, but**many of them might often remain outdated** , especially your graphics drivers.

 If you wonder how to update specific drivers after upgrading to Windows 11, you will find all your need to know in this post.

**Pro Tip:** If you’re not tech-savvy, or you’re short on time and patience, you can try updating all your drivers on Windows 11 with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  in one click.

## How to update drivers on Windows 11

 Whether you want to do it manually or automatically, below you will find two different step-by-step installation guides.

* **[Manually](#1)**
* **[Automatically](#2)**

### Option 1\. Update drivers via Device Manager

 To update a device driver manually, you will first need to**download the latest and correct driver** for your specific device and**update the driver with Device Manager** .

1. You will be able to download the driver on the manufacturer’s website, most likely in their**Driver** ,**Downloads,** or**Support** section.  

 If you can’t find the driver online, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  (a trusted source for millions of verified drivers) to download the correct driver for you.
2. Right-click the Start menu ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image-1.png) and click**Device Manager** .

3. In the**Device Manager** window, expand the category and the device that you wish to update the driver for. If you need to update Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller, you’ll find this device under the**Network adapters** category. You can right-click on the device name and select**Update driver** .

7. Once complete, you now have the latest driver installed. You can restart your PC for it to take full effect.

### Option 2\. Update all drivers automatically

 You can download any outdated driver with Driver Easy, and it’s completely free. However, if you don’t want to go through the manual update, you can update it with **[Driver Easy Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  automatically.

 Unlike downloading a driver and installing it manually, you can update all your drivers with just one click.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the [**7 days free trial**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. It takes just 2 clicks, and you get full support and a 30-day money-back guarantee with the Pro version:

3. Click the**Activate & Update** button next to the flagged device to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver.  

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (You’ll need the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  for this – when you select Update All, you’ll get a prompt to upgrade. If you’re not prepared to purchase the Pro version yet, Driver Easy provides a 7-day trial at no cost, granting access to all Pro features like fast downloads and easy installation.
