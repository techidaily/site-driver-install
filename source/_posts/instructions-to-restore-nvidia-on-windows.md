## Step 1: Uninstall the graphics driver

 You can uninstall the driver via Device Manager. Device Manager is a Control Panel application that allows you to manage devices and drivers in your system. You can uninstall, update, or roll back drivers via Device Manager.

 Follow these steps to uninstall the NVIDIA graphics driver via Device Manager:

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows** logo key and**R** keyat the same time to invoke the Run box.
2. Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** to open the Device Manager window.

6. Repeat the same to remove the driver for your other Nvidia display card if you have one.

 The option Delete the driver software for this device allows you to delete the driver package from the Driver Store (For more information about Driver Store, please see [**here**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store) .)

 If you don’t see this option on the Uninstall confirmation dialog box, the driver package probably has been removed. In this case, just click**Uninstall** to uninstall only the driver.

 After uninstalling the driver, move on to**[Step 2](#install)** to install a new NVIDIA driver.
