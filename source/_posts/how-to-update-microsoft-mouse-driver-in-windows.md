4) Wait a bit and see if Windows provides you with a driver available:

* If**yes** , then follow the on-screen instructions to update the driver and skip the rest of the steps. Then restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
* If**no** , and instead you got the message **The best drivers for your device already installed** , then you might have to continue with the following steps to get the latest driver for your mouse. Since the message isn’t always true and Windows can fail to do its job.

6) Search**the model** of your mouse, click the right download link for your Windows Operating System  . Usually a few download options will be listed but you might want to click   **the first**  result for the latest driver version.

8) Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.
