 If you have a**Netgear AC1200 Wifi USB adapter** , you’ll need to download and update your**Netgear Wifi adapter driver** when connecting it to your Windows computer. To make sure you have ultimate speed and performance, the manufacturer keeps releasing new drivers to boost stability and reliability.

 There are two ways you can update your Netgear AC1200 Wifi USB Adapter drivers:

[**Option 1 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

[**Option 2 – Manually**](#method1)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

### Option 1 – Automatically update Netgear wifi adapter drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the Bluetooth driver manually, you can**do it automatically** with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

4) Restart your computer to take effect.

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with full technical support.  
 If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**

7) Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the update.

 Then you should have **updated your Netgear AC1200 Wifi USB adapter driver to the latest version** .

 But if you’re told “The best drivers for your device are already installed”, you need to visit their [official download center](https://www.netgear.com/support/product/A6150.aspx) for the latest driver and install it manually.
