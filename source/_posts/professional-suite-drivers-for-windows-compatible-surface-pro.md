 If you’re having a driver issue in your Microsoft Surface Pro 4, don’t worry. You can solve the driver issue easily by downloading and updating the**Surface Pro 4 drivers** in your Windows system.

### Method 1: Download and install Surface Pro 4 drivers manually

 1) Go to **[Microsoft download center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49498)** [.](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=49498)

 2) Select the appropriate language, and click**Download** .

 This requires time and computer skills. If you don’t have time or patience, or sometimes if you can’t find the latest version of a specific device driver from the website, you can try [Method 2](#Fix2) .
