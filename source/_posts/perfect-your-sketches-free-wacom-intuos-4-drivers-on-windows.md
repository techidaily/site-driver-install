## Perfect Your Sketches: Free Wacom Intuos 4 Drivers on Windows

![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/img_5b5af7bfcbd83-300x204.jpg) If you want to keep your **Wacom Intuos 4**  in tip-top shape, you should keep your Wacom Intuos 4 driver up to date.

There are two ways to update your Wacom Intuos 4 driver:

1. [**Update your Wacom Intuos 4 driver manually**](#o1)
2. [**Update your Wacom Intuos 4 driver automatically (Recommended)**](#o2)

## Option 1: Update your Wacom Intuos 4 driver manually

You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your driver this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step. You can head to the [Wacom website](https://www.wacom.com/en/support/product-support/drivers) and check out the section for driver downloads. **Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with the exact model number of your Wacom tablet, and your version of Windows.**Then download and install the driver manually.
