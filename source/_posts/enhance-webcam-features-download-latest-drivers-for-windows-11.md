### Fix 2: Update the driver automatically – Fast & Quick

 If you don’t have time or patience, you can update the Logitech C270 driver automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the**FREE** or the**Pro** version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a**30-day money back guarantee**):

 3) Click the**Update** button next to the flagged Logitech device to automatically download the correct version of the driver (you can do this with the**FREE** version), then install the driver on your computer.

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of all the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
