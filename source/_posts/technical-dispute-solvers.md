## Technical Dispute Solvers

**System Recourse**

 A system resource is any usable part of a computer that can be controlled and assigned by the operating system so all of the hardware and software on the computer can work together as designed.

 Hardware and software need a way to communicate with each other, and they do so by using a combination of four system resources:

**IRQ**

 Hardware devices use the IRQ bus on a motherboard to signal the CPU for attention.

**Port addresses**

 Software addresses a hardware device using the devices port, or I/O, address.

 The device “listens” to the bus to determine if it is being requested.

**Memory addresses**

 Software communicates with physical memory located in either RAM or ROM chips using memory addresses.

**DMA channel**

 Data travels back and forth between memory and a hardware device using this channel.

**Resource Conflicts**

Resource conflicts can manifest themselves in several different ways.

 Some conflicts can be very easy to recognize; others can be extremely difficult to find and correct,

 **Here are some of the ways that resource conflicts manifest themselves.**

 Some of these may be consistent and repeatable, while others may be intermittent:

System hangs or lockups, particularly while using a peripheral device.

(Memory) parity errors on parity-enabled systems.

Noise or other problems from sound cards.

Junk being printed on your printer.

 The mouse pointer hanging and refusing to move, or moving in a stuttering fashion.

 Error messages from Windows 95, messages about the PC not operating at maximum performance, or the system dropping to “Safe Mode” or “MS-DOS Compatibility Mode”.

Errors and crashes of applications for no apparent reason.
