 After uninstalling your mouse driver, move on to [step 2](#step2) to install a new one.

## Step 2 – Install a new mouse driver

 To get a new mouse driver installed on your computer, you just need to restart your computer, and upon startup, the system will automatically reinstall the mouse driver to your system.

 However, this method may not give you the latest driver. If you have any input lag issues, we recommend using Driver Easy to help you detect any missing drivers, and download and install them automatically.

 Here, we recommend**Driver Easy** as your great pick to update your drivers. It’s a useful tool that automatically recognizes your system and finds the correct drivers for it.
