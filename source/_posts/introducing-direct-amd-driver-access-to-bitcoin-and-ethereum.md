## Introducing Direct AMD Driver Access to Bitcoin & Ethereum

 Want to download and install the**AMD Blockchain Compute driver** in your Windows computer to enhance your mining work? You’ve come to the right place! This post will show you how to download and install the**AMD Blockchain driver in Windows 10 and Windows 7** .  The normal AMD graphics card drivers both support your graphics usage, gaming workload, and your Blockchain Compute workloads, but the AMD Blockchain drivers are enhanced only for Blockchain compute workloads. So if you want to maximize using your AMD graphics card in your mining work, it’s recommended to install the AMD Blockchain drivers for Windows computers.

## How to download and install AMD Blockchain drivers?

1. [Download and install AMD Blockchain drivers manually](#Fix1)
2. [Bonus Tip: Update your AMD graphics drivers automatically](#Fix2)

### Download and install AMD Blockchain drivers manually

 AMD provides the AMD Blockchain drivers for you to download and install, so you can manually search for the AMD Blockchain drivers, select the proper one and install it in your computer. Here’s how to do it:  1) Open [Radeon Software Crimson Relive Edition Beta for Blockchain Compute Release Notes](https://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/Radeon-Software-Crimson-ReLive-Edition-Beta-for-Blockchain-Compute-Release-Notes.aspx) .  2) Read the notes and EndUser License Agreement carefully, then download the AMD Blockchain driver that is compatible with your**Windows operating system** (in may case I select Radeon Software Crimson Relive Edition Best for Blockchain Compute Driver for Windows 10 64 bit).

 3) After downloaded, you should uninstall your existing AMD graphics card driver in your computer. You can do this by navigating to**Control Panel** \>**Programs and Features** \>**AMD Installer** \>**Uninstall** .

 4) After uninstalling the existing AMD graphics driver, run the AMD Blockchain driver that you just downloaded.  5) Follow the on-screen instructions and finish installing your AMD Blockchain driver.  As noted on the AMD website, this Blockchain driver is provided as a beta level and will not be supported with further updates or fixes. So you should look carefully before you download.  Kindly note that the AMD Blockchain drivers are compatible with certain AMD graphics card models, such as  Radeon™ RX 500 Series Graphics, so pay attention to what your AMD graphics card is and make sure it’s compatible with the AMD Blockchain driver.

###  Bonus Tip: Update AMD graphics drivers automatically

 As you should know, the AMD Blockchain drivers supports only Windows 10 and Windows 8, and some certain AMD graphics cards. So if your AMD graphics card or your Windows operating system is not supported by the AMD Blockchain driver, you should also consider updating your AMD graphics card driver to the latest version in order to have the best possible performance.  Manually downloading the AMD Blockchain drivers requires time and computer skills. If you don’t have time or patience, you can automatically update your drivers with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .  Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it.
