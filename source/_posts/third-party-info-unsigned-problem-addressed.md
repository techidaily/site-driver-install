## What is an INF file and why it should contain digital signature information?

An INF file is a text file to supply the driver setup information for your Windows to install the driver. It comes with the driver file you download. If you’re using Windows 10 or 8, the INF file should contain digital signature information extra. That’s due to the “driver signature enforcement” security feature in these Windows. This feature requires the drivers you install should be signed by Microsoft. So if the driver your Windows try to install is old unsigned or inofficial, Windows 10 or 8 can’t load it, then you would receive the error above.

## How to solve the problem to install my driver successfully?

As we know, we should install the driver signed by Microsoft on Windows 8, 10\. Then what kind of driver is signed by Microsoft? That would be those downloaded from the device manufacturers’ website and some trustworthy driver tool. So you can go with the following methods to download the correct drivers. **Method 1:[Download the driver from manufacturer’s website manually](#METHOD1)**   **Method 2:[Download the driver automatically by Driver Easy \[RECOMMENDED\]](#METHOD2)**
