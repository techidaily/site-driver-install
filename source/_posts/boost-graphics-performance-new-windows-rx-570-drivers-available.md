## Boost Graphics Performance: New Windows RX 570 Drivers Available

 If you got an AMD RX 570 graphics card and hope it to draw the smooth, high-end graphics performance all the time, it’s necessary to get a correct and up-to-date driver for it. In this tutorial, you’ll learn 2 quick & easy ways to download and install AMD RX 570 drivers on Windows 11, 10, and 7.

**[Option 1 – Manually](#option1)** – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find the exactly right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#option2)**  – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

## Option 1 – Download and install the AMD RX 570 drivers manually

 AMD keeps releasing new drivers for its graphics cards. If you feel like updating the AMD RX 570 drivers by yourself, please carefully follow the steps below:

1. Go to **[AMD’s support website](https://www.amd.com/en/support)**  .
2. Click**Graphics** \>**Raden 500 Series** \>**Raden RX 500 Series** \>**Raden RX 570** .

3. Select your**operating system** . (For my case, I choose Windows 10 – 64-Bit Edition.)

4. Click the**Download** button next to the driver you want.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

 The manual driver update process is a bit time-consuming and error-prone. If you prefer a simpler method, check out the second option below.

## Option 2 – Automatically update the AMD RX 570 drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the AMD RX 570 drivers manually, you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

3. Click the**Update** button next to the flagged_AMD RX 570 driver_ to automatically download the correct version of this driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).  

 Or click**Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of_all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click**Update All** ).
