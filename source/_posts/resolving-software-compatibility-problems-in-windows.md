## Resolving Software Compatibility Problems in Windows

If you used Windows to update drivers automatically, and encountered error “Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software”, it means the driver could not be updated in this way. In this case, you can update drivers manually by downloading drivers from manufacturers. You can also use a driver update tool to help you.

 If the driver is having problem and cannot be updated due to this error, you can just [uninstall the driver](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and restart Windows. After that, Windows should load the driver again. Then your device should work again. Note the reinstalled driver might not be in a newer version.  
  
 To update the driver to a newer version, you can use one of two ways below.  
  
 **Way 1: Download Drivers from Manufacturers**
  
You can go to the device manufacturer’s website to check and download the latest driver for your device. If the device is built in your brand computer, it is recommended that you go to the PC manufacturer’s website to check for the drivers first, as they might supply the best matched driver for your device. The drivers always can be downloaded from Support or Download section of the website. Before you get started, ensure that you know the device model or PC model, and the specific operating system that your PC is running.  
  
 **Way 2: Update Drivers Using Driver Easy**
As you can see, Windows does not always successfully update drivers. And updating drivers manually can be time consuming. If you want to have drivers updated successfully and more easily, you can use **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) t**o help you. Driver Easy can detect all problem drivers in your computer and recommend new drivers. With friendly UI, Driver Easy allows you to download new drivers with just 2 clicks.
