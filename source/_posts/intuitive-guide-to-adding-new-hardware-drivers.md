## Intuitive Guide to Adding New Hardware Drivers

 As you know, a driver is software that a device uses to work with your PC. When your device isn’t working properly, you can check if the driver is installed correctly. A faulty driver could always be the cause. To fix the problem, you need to update the driver. For some devices, Windows can update the driver automatically. For some devices especially external devices, you need to install the updated drivers yourself, then you need to download the driver manually.

## Download the driver manually

 To download new drivers, go to the PC manufacturer’s website or the device manufacturer’s website. Driver updates are often available in the Support section of their website. If you are using a branded computer, it is recommended that you go to the PC manufacturer’s website to check for the latest driver first, as they may customize the driver. You are required to use the **PC model** and the **operating system** that you are using to download the correct driver. Usually, the PC model can be found on the machine. See [How to Check Your Operating System Version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . If you need to download the driver from device manufacturer, then you are required to know the device model.

## How to install the driver

 The downloaded driver file will be an executable file (The file name ends in “.exe”.) or a zip file (The file name ends in “.zip”.).

 For an executable file, to install the driver, you just need to double-click on the file and follow the on-screen instructions.

 For a zip file, you need to unzip it and find the executable file in the archive. If you cannot find an executable file, you need to install the driver step by step using the “**.inf** ” file. The following steps are for your reference how to install the driver in this way.

1. On your keyboard, press the**Windows logo + R keys** simultaneously to open the Run box. Then type**devmgmt.msc** and hit Enter.
