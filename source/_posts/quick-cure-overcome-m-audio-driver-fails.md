 If your M-Track interface isn’t working properly, you may be using a wrong M-Track driver or it’s out of date. You should update your M-Track driver to fix issues with your interface and keep it healthy.

**There are two ways to update your M-Track drivers:**

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#op1) – You can download and install the update for your driver yourself. This requires some time, patience, and sometimes even computer skills

OR

**[Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)](#op2)**  – This is the quicker and easier option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

##  Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 M-Audio releases its driver updates on its official website. You can find the latest update for your M-Track driver there and download it to your computer.

 Pay close attention to the drivers you’re looking — you need to find the one that is**up to date** and**suitable for your variant of operating system** .

 Then open the file that you’ve just downloaded and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver step by step.
