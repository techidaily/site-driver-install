![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Yamaha-Logo-1967-1200x576.jpg)

 To make sure your Yamaha Steinberg audio interface works to its best performance, you should always keep the Yamaha Steinberg USB driver. In this article, we provide a step-to-step guide about how to update it to the latest version.

## About Yamaha Steinberg Series

 With the Steinberg series, you can record studio-grade sound, right on your laptop or iPad. When connected to a Windows PC, it’s also a perfect fit for pro-level recording.

 For the most time, it works just great. But sometimes it may bump into issues, such as the sound would drop out on playback. The main cause of that is outdated USB 2.0 and Bluetooth 4.0 drivers.

 It’s always recommended to keep the drivers up to date so that you can complete your project at full ease.

## How to update Yamaha Steinberg USB drivers

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#method1)

 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

[**Option 2 – Automatically (Recommended)**](#method2)

 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
