## Option 1:Download and install the latest Wacom Bamboo driver manually

 Wacom keeps updating drivers. To get them, you need to go to the official Wacom website, find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 64 bit) and download the driver manually.

 Once you’ve downloaded the correct drivers for your system, double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.
