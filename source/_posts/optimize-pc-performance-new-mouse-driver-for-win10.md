## Optimize PC Performance: New Mouse Driver for Win10

You may already know that Logitech often update their mouse drivers, so that their mouse can work more efficiently by adding new features or fixing some bugs. And they have updated the drivers after Windows 10 released. If you upgrade to Windows 10, it is necessary to update your Logitech mouse drivers, especially for gaming mouse drivers which may boot your game experience a lot.

You can go to [Logitech official website](http://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads) to download and install the latest Windows 10 drivers manually. But if you often go to their website and check for the latest version, it is obviously time consuming. Instead of manually updating Logitech mouse drivers, we recommend using **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)** .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now** . Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to a flagged Logitech mouse driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
