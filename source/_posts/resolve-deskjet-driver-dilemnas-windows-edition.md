## Resolve Deskjet Driver Dilemnas, Windows Edition

 After you upgrade the system to Windows 10, if your HP Deskjet printer doesn’t work as you expected or encounter problems, it most properly has driver issues. In this case, you need to fix the driver issues by updating the drivers.

 [20151215145824](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151215145824.png) ](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/20151215145824.png)

  New system always has driver compatibility issues, especially for Windows 10\. For many manufacturers, they have not released Windows 10 drivers, as Windows 10 was released not long ago. So HP may not release Windows 10 drivers for your printer model.

  HP has declared that Most HP printers in use with Windows 7 or Windows 8 will continue to work smoothly without the need to reinstall drivers. If you upgrade from Windows 7 or Windows 8, your HP Deskjet printer should have worked with no problems. Or you may need to install the latest Windows 10 driver.

  Following are the common HP Deskjet printers which have Windows 10 drivers. If your printer is one of them, it supports Windows 10\. To quickly locate your printer model, hold down the**CTRL** and**F** keys. In the search box that displays, type the printer model number and press **Enter** to find your printer.

  If your printer doesn’t have Windows 10 driver, you can check if it has additional drivers, which may be right for Windows 10\. The additional drivers are **Basic driver** , **Universal Print Driver** , **PCL 6 driver** , **HP Enterprise driver** ,   **HP Host-based Plug and Play (PnP) driver** .

  There are three methods below you can use to update the drivers. They are two traditional methods and one more effective method.

 **Method 1:**

**Download the driver from HP**

  Go to [HP Customer Support – Software and Driver Downloads](http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers) . Then enter your HP model number to find your product. After that, you will be directed to the download page. You can find the right drivers there. If you can find Windows 10 driver, your printer definitely supports Windows 10\. (example: j110a).  Usually, you just need to double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver. If there is no Windows 10 driver, try the additional drivers.

  1\. Enter your HP Deskjet Printer model then click on **Find my product button.**

 4\. Click the link that tells you optional updates are available. (If you don’t see this link, it means Windows Update didn’t find any updates for your computer.)

 5\. Select the driver you want to install, click **OK** , and then click **Install updates** .

  You need to update drivers manually by using Method 1 and Method 2\. And it may take you a lot of time to find drivers and install the drivers. Following you will learn the most effective update method.

 **Method 3:**

 **Use [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to update the drivers automatically**
