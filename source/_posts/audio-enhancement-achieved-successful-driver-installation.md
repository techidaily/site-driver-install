## Audio Enhancement Achieved: Successful Driver Installation

 If you want to update Conexant High Definition Audio driver in Windows 10, there are three ways that you can use. Read on then you’ll get how to update the driver step by step.

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the driver manually, we recommend you use Way 3 to do it automatically.

[**Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager**](#way1)

[**Way 2: Manually Update Conexant Audio Driver**](#way2)

[**Way 3: Automatically Update Conexant Audio Driver**](#way3)

##  Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager

 An easy to update the driver is via Device Manager. But please note that it does’t always work as Windows may fail to load the new driver.

Follow below steps to update the driver in Device Manager.

 1\. Press**Win+R** (Windows key and R key) at the same time. A Run dialog will appear.

 2\. Type**devmgmt.msc** in the run box and click**OK** button.

## **Way 2: Manually Update Conexant Audio Driver**

Conexant does not provide C onexant HD Audio Drivers for Windows 10  on their website. So you need to go to the PC manufacturer’s website to download the Conexant audio driver. To download the correct driver, you need to know the PC model and the version of Windows.

##   **Way 3: Automatically Update Conexant Audio Driver**

 If Way 1 and Way 2 don’t work for you, or if you don’t have patience, time or computer skills to update the driver manually,  you can do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the Pro version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks (and you get full support and a 30-day money back guarantee):

 1) **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**   and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click **Scan Now**   button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update** button next to the Conexant audio driver to automatically download and install the correct version of this driver (you can do this with the FREE version). Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
