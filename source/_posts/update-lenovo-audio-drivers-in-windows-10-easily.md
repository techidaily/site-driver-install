If you want to update audio drivers for your Lenovo PC with Windows 10, there are 3 ways you can use. Read on and find the way that works for you.  
  
**Way 1: Download and Install the Driver from Lenovo**
  
Mostly, if your PC model supports Windows 10, you can download the latest Windows 10 driver from Lenovo official website. Following steps are for your reference how to download the Windows 10 audio driver according to your PC model. Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system (Windows 10 32-bit or Windows 10 64-bit).  
  
1\. Go to [Lenovo SUPPORT center](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2FGlobalProductSelector%3FC%3D1%26TabName%26linkTrack)  where you can download drivers and software.

 The downloaded driver file will be in self-installing format. After download completes, just double-click on the file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

Follow these steps to install new audio drivers via Device Manager.  
  
1\. Press**Win+R**(**Windows logo**key and**R**key) at the same time. A Run dialog box will appear. Then Device Manager will open.
