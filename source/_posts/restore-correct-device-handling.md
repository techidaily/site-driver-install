 If your FTDI cannot be recognized by your computer, you can try to update the FTDI USB to serial driver to fix the issue.

**Note** : If you click on the version name, you’ll get driver with .inf file which requires you to install the driver step by step through [Device Manager](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) .
