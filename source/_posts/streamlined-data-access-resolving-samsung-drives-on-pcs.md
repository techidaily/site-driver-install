 If you’re having an issue with your**Samsung SSD (Solid-State Drive) driver** , and want to download or update the driver for your Samsung SSD in your Windows computer? You’ve come to the right place. This post will show you how to download or update the Samsung SSD drivers.

## How to download or update Samsung SSD driver?

1. [Download Samsung SSD driver manually](#Fix1)
2. [Update Samsung SSD driver automatically (Recommended)](#Fix3)
3. [Update Samsung SSD driver via Device Manager](#Fix2)
  
 Note: the screenshots below come from Windows 10, and the fixes also work on Windows 8 and Windows 7.

###  Fix 1: Download Samsung SSD driver manually

 You can manually download the driver for your Samsung SSD from the Samsung website.

 However, only some of the SSD drivers are available to download in Samsung Support center, such as  Samsung NVMe SSD 970 PRO, 970 EVO, 960 PRO, 960 EVO and 950 PRO. Apart from those, you may need to try [Fix 2](#Fix2) to download the SSD driver from Windows, as Samsung only provides the firmware downloads.

 1) Go to [Samsung Support center](https://shop-links.co/link/?exclusive=1&publisher_slug=itechdaily19598&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsung.com%2Fsupport%2F) , and search for your SSD driver. For instance, you can search for**Samsung NVMe SSD 970 PRO** .

This requires time and computer skills.
