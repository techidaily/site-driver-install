## Xbox Control Software: Windows 10 Compatibility

 After you connect your Xbox One Controller to your Windows 10 PC, you find that you can’t play games using the controller. You may assume the driver is not installed. But it’s expected that Windows automatically downloads and installs the driver for the controller. What happen then?

 You’re right that Windows 10 automatically installs the driver as soon as you connect it to the computer. But it’s still possible that Windows doesn’t install the driver. In this case, you need to update the driver on your own. There are two ways to install and update the driver. Just choose the way that’s easier for you.

 **Way 1:[Update the Driver via Device Manager](#way1)**
 **Way 2:[Update the Driver Using Driver Easy](#way2)**

## Way 1: Update the Driver via Device Manager

 If Windows doesn’t install the driver automatically, you can update the driver manually via Device Manager. Follow these steps:

 1) On your keyboard, press**Win+R** (Windows logo key and R key) at the same time to invoke the run box.

 2) Type**devmgmt.msc** and press**Enter** on your keyboard.

 Or click **Update All**  to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_   the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system (this requires the Pro version – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
