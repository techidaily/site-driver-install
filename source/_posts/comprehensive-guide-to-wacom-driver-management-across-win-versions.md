   * C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\WTablet  
   * C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\wactemp  
   * C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Local\\Wacom
4. Go to**C:\\Windows\\System32\\** and delete the following files:  
   * WacDriverDLCoinst.dll  
   * Wacom\_Tablet.dll  
   * Wacom\_Touch\_Tablet.dll  
   * WacomMT.dll  
   * WacomTabletUserDefaults.xml  
   * WacomTouchUserDefaults.xml  
   * Wacom\_Tablet.dat

### Step 2: Reinstall the latest Wacom drivers

 There’re 2 ways you can reinstall the latest Wacom drivers: manually or automatically (recommended).

#### Option 1: Reinstall the Wacom drivers manually

 If you’re familiar with computer hardware, you can try to reinstall the Wacom drivers manually.

 To do so, visit the Wacom support page and search for your device model. Then download the correct drivers that’s compatible with your operating system.

#### Option 2: Reinstall the Wacom drivers automatically (Recommended)

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to reinstall the Wacom drivers manually, you can, instead, do it automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  . Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for your exact device, and your Windows version, and it will download and install them correctly:

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.(This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)
