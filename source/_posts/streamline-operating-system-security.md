 Use [Driver Easy Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) to download and install Intel(R) Management Engine Interface driver immediately!

 You may have seen **Intel Management Engine Interface (IMEI)**  somewhere in your computer before but you’re not sure what it is or what it does. No worries, you’re not alone.

 Actually, it’s quite an important device. It works to make sure that your PC is running at its peak performance. It also ensures that Intel subsystem is communicating properly with your operating system.

 If your USB connection is off, or that you are having problem with your remote communication, you need to get its driver updated.

 In this article, we’ll show you how to download and install **Intel Management Engine Driver**  fast and easily.
  
**[Step 1: Download Intel Management Driver](#1)**
**[Step 2: Install the driver accordingly](#2)**

**Note** : The screen shots below are shown in Windows 10, but all the fixes apply to Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 as well.

## **Step 1: Download Intel Management Driver**

 Just download it directly from Intel web page:

**[Intel Management Engine Driver for WIndows 10, 8.1, 7 for Intel NUC](https://downloadmirror.intel.com/26135/eng/ME%5FConsumer%5FWin8.1%5F10%5F11.0.6.1194.zip)**

## **Step 2: Install the driver accordingly**

 1) You will be downloading a .zip file to your computer. Un-zip it first.
