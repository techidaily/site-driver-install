5. On the Uninstall confirm dialog box, select the**Delete the driver software for this device** option, then click**Uninstall** .  
![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/img_5be003fba7ed5.png)  
 The option**Delete the driver software for this device** allows you to delete the driver package from the Driver Store (For more information you can visit [Driver Store](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/install/driver-store) in Microsoft. If you don’t see this option on the**Uninstall confirm dialog** box, the driver package may have been removed. In this case, just click**Uninstall** to uninstall the driver.

6. **Restart** your computer. Usually, Windows will install an audio driver automatically when your computer is connected to the internet. (It may not give you the latest drivers — so if you found the issue persists, you can take the following methods to automatically check for driver issues or updates.)
