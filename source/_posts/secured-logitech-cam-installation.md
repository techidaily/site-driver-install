 If you want to keep your Logitech webcam in tip-top shape, you should keep your Logitech webcam driver up-to-date.

There are two ways to update your Logitech webcam driver:

1. [**Update your Logitech webcam driver manually**](#method1)
2. **[Update your Logitech webcam driver automatically (100% Safe) (Recommended)](#method2)**

 You can first head to the **[Logitech Support page](https://support.logitech.com/en%5Fus/downloads)**  and select the device model of your Logitech webcam. Then check out the section for driver downloads. **Be sure to choose the driver that’s compatible with your Windows operating system** , and then download and install the driver manually.
