![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/4-1024x779.jpg)

 If you are looking for a SCSI driver, this article will tell you two ways to get it.  
 The following content will tell you what is SCSI, SCSI driver function and how to update SCSI driver.

### What is SCSI?

 Small Computer System Interface (SCSI) is a set of universal interface standards. It can physically link and transmit data between computers and peripheral devices such as printers, hard disks, scanners, etc.

 SCSI driver is like a translator to communicate with the SCSI adapter installed inside the computer to make the product work properly. This high-speed data transmission technology is widely used on small computers.

### How to update SCSI drivers?

There are two ways you can update your SCSI drivers:

[**Option 1 – Manually**](#op1) – You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way, because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.

OR

[**Option 2 – Automatically**](#op2) (Recommended) – This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.

#### Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 1) Find the model name of your product. You can check the product’s outer packaging to find its model name.

 2) According to the model name, go to the product’s manufacturer official website. Find the drivers corresponding with your specific flavor of Windows version (for example, Windows 32 bit) and download the driver manually.

 3) Double-click on the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install the driver.

#### Option 2 – Automatically update SCSI drivers

 If you don’t have the time, patience or computer skills to update the SCSI driver manually, you can do it automatically with Driver Easy.

 Driver Easy will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.

 You can update your drivers automatically with either the FREE or the [**Pro version**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes just 2 clicks:

 1)[**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install Driver Easy.

 2) Run Driver Easy and click the**Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

 3) Click the **Update**  button next to the selected driver to automatically download the correct version of that driver, then you can manually install it (you can do this with the FREE version).

 Or click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system. (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  which comes with full support and a 30-day money back guarantee. You’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All.)
