![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/img_5af0328223eef-269x300.jpg)

If your Lexmark printer isn’t working properly, or if you want to keep it in good condition, you should update its driver as soon as possible.

### There are two ways to update your Lexmark printer driver

[**Option 1** **– Manually:**](#man) You can download and install the update for your driver yourself. This requires some time, patience, and sometimes even computer skills

OR

[**Option 2** **– Automatically (Recommended):**](#auto) This is the quicker and easier option. This requires just a couple of mouse clicks!

## Option 1: Download and install your driver manually

To get the correct driver for your Lexmark printer, you should go to the **[Lexmark official website](https://www.lexmark.com/)**  and search for your printer driver download page, where Lexmark releases drivers and software for this printer. You need to download the correct and latest driver.

 Download the driver that’s suitable for your variant of Windows system. You should know what system is running on your computer — whether it’s Windows 7, 8 or 10, 32-bit or 64-bit version, etc.

When the download process has completed, open the downloaded file and follow the on-screen instructions to install it on your computer.

## Option 2: Update your driver automatically

If you don’t have the time, patience or skills to update your driver manually, you can do it automatically with [**Driver Easy**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) . **Driver Easy**  will automatically recognize your system and find the correct drivers for it. You don’t need to know exactly what system your computer is running, you don’t need to risk downloading and installing the wrong driver, and you don’t need to worry about making a mistake when installing.  You can download and install your drivers by using either Free or **Pro**  version of Driver Easy. But with the Pro version it takes only **2**  clicks (and you get **full support** and a **30-day money back guarantee**): **1)** [**Download**](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) and install **Driver Easy** . **2)** Run **Driver Easy** and click the **Scan Now** button. **Driver Easy**  will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers. ![](https://images.drivereasy.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/img_5ad448343f7d8.png) **3)**  Click the **Update**  button next to Lexmark printer to download the latest and correct driver for it. You can also click the **Update All**  button at the bottom right to automatically update all outdated or missing drivers on your computer (this requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  — you will be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All).
