 If your PC is having graphics-related issues, such as screen flickering and control panel not opening, one quick and nuclear solution is to reinstall the graphics driver with**Display Driver Uninstaller** , the most powerful driver removal utility.

 In this step-by-step guide, we’ll show you how to reinstall drivers with DDU, and what you should do next to prevent the issues from happening again.

 If your PC comes with dual GPUs, you might need to connect your monitor to the display ports on the motherboard.

## How to reinstall GPU drivers using DDU

Here’s how to do a clean reinstallation of your graphics driver:

 In case things go sideways, you should backup your important files first.

1. First make sure you have DDU downloaded on your PC. If you haven’t, go to the **[official download page](https://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html)**  , scroll to the bottom and select a download location.  
 If you’re planing to**install a specific verison of graphics driver** , make sure to download that installer first and install the driver offline after the reinstalltion.

2. Once downloaded, unzip the file to your Desktop. Then open the folder and double click**DDU.exe** to extract the files.

#### Windows 10

1. Next you need to enter Safe Mode. On your keyboard, press**Win+I** (the Windows logo key and the i key). Select**Update & Security** .

4. Once DDU purged the graphics driver, your PC should restart. You can now check if the graphics issue persists.

So you’ve reinstalled the graphics driver, what next?

## How to prevent graphics issues

 After reinstalling drivers with DDU, Windows will download and install the generic graphics driver automatically.

**But that’s not good enough!**

 To get the most of your GPU and fix the issues once and for all, you need to**keep your drivers up to date** . An outdated graphics driver can lead to tons of graphics issues.

 You can update your graphics driver manually, by visiting the manufacturer’s websites ([NVIDIA](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) /[AMD](https://www.amd.com/en/support) /[Intel](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/products/80939/graphics.html) ), finding your model and downloading the latest correct installer. But if you’re not comfortable playing with device drivers, you can update automatically with **[Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

1. **[Download](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  and install Driver Easy.
2. Run Driver Easy and click the **Scan Now** button. Driver Easy will then scan your computer and detect any problem drivers.

3. Click **Update All** to automatically download and install the correct version of _all_ the drivers that are missing or out of date on your system.  
 (This requires the **[Pro version](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  – you’ll be prompted to upgrade when you click Update All. If you don’t want to pay for the Pro version, you can still download and install all the drivers you need with the free version; you just have to download them one at a time, and manually install them, the normal Windows way.)

**The Pro version of Driver Easy** comes with _full technical support_ . If you need assistance, please contact **Driver Easy’s support team** at **[support@drivereasy.com](mailto:support@drivereasy.com) .**

 After updating your drivers, restart your PC for the changes to take full effect.
