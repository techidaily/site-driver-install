## Option 1 – Download and install the driver manually

 NVIDIA releases new graphics drivers on a regular basis and you need to head for its official website to check for updates. Here are the steps:

2. Choose**GeForce GTX 1650** from the product list and select your operating system. Then click**Search** .  
 To download the optimized driver for the latest games, choose**Game Ready Drivers** for Download Type, or you can select**Studio Drivers** for design purposes.
