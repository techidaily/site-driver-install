## How to update your Focusrite Scarlett 6i6 driver?

When it comes to updating a driver, you always have 2 options :

* Option 1 –**[Automatically update](#o1)**  
 This is the quickest and easiest option. It’s all done with just a couple of mouse clicks – easy even if you’re a computer newbie.
* Option 2 –**[Manually update](#o2)**  
 You’ll need some computer skills and patience to update your drivers this way because you need to find exactly the right driver online, download it and install it step by step.
