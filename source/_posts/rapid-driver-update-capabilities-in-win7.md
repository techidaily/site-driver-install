 There are two ways you can update the drivers in Windows 7: manually & automatically; just select the way you prefer.

## **Manual driver update:**  

 You can update the drivers manually via Deivce Manager. Follow these steps.

 1) On your desktop, press and hold the **Start** button and right-click**Computer** then click **Manage** . This is to open Device Manager.

 2) Click **Device Manager** in left pane.

 3) Double click the device name that you wish to update the driver for. This is to expand the list of the this device.

 For instance, if you wish to update “Realtek High Definition Audio” driver, double-click “Sound, video and game controller” branch then you’ll see the “High Definition Audio Device” under this branch. Then right-click the device name and select **Update Driver Software…**

**Note:**  For some devices, the device name displayed in Driver Easy is different from the device name displayed in Device Manager.  

 In [Driver Easy](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/) , you can click on the driver and get the name of current driver. Then locate the device in Device Manager using this name.

 4) Click **Browse my Computer for driver software.**
