### Method 1: Manually

 Before you get started, ensure that you know the PC model and the specific operating system that you are using (Windows 10 64-bit or Windows 10 32-bit).

 When you download drivers manually, ensure that you download the drivers from [ASUS official](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBBT400/HelpDesk%5FDownload/) , which are definitely safe for your computer.

1. Go to the [driver download page](https://www.asus.com/us/Networking/USBBT400/HelpDesk%5FDownload/) for USB-BT400.
2. Select your operating system.

3. The latest version of the Asus USB-BT400 driver will show up.
4. Click the**DOWNLOAD** button.
5. Unzip the downloaded driver file to a specific location.
6. Once complete, go to the Win10\_USB-BT400\_x86-x64\_Installer folder, and locate the setup application.
7. Right-click setup, and select**Run as administrator** .
